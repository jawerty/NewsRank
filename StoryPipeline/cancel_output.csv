Captain America needed a hero this weekend and he’s appreciative that the fans assembled. On Saturday “Avengers” star Chris Evans reportedly was simply trying to post an Instagram video before accidentally revealing NSFW images from his camera roll including a penis pic. The incident had the actor trending on Twitter over the weekend and fans came to the rescue reportedly flooding the term “Chris Evans” with wholesome pictures and urging people to respect his privacy. Now Evans is opening up about those ... uh ... private parts of his life being revealed. On the “Tamron Hall” show on Tuesday the actor first feigned ignorance joking “Something happen this weekend?” Evans had initially addressed the incident on Monday using the added attention to steer people to the polls which Hall commended him on. “That’s called turning a frown upside down Tamron” Evans said. “Look. It was a very interesting weekend full of lessons learned. A lot of teachable moments.” The actor went on to call his mishap “embarrassing” but added “You gotta roll with the punches.” He was also appreciative of the help he got from fans. “I will say I have some pretty fantastic fans who really came to my support” the actor said. “That was really really nice.” He may be a superhero but sometimes even Cap needs a little saving.

How Well The Post Office Functions Could Make Or Break The 2020 Election,headline,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/usps-election-voting-post-office_n_5f61022bc5b6e27db133eacb,huffingtonpost.com,1600223579509
In 2016 the voter registration deadlines in Florida Georgia and South Carolina happened to fall around the same date that Hurricane Matthew the first Category 5 storm to hit the Atlantic in almost a decade was projected to make a catastrophic landfall. The Saturday before the hurricane was due to hit Tammy Patrick’s phone rang. Ronald Stroman No. 2 at the U.S. Postal Service warned that local post offices would be closed during the storm and wanted to know if he should send postal carriers to Red Cross tents to postmark voter registration forms. “My god there’s a hurricane coming and the deputy of the U.S. Postal Service is on top of when voter registration deadlines are” Patrick a senior adviser at the nonprofit Democracy Fund Voice recalls thinking. “Under previous postmasters the Postal Service literally moved mountains to make sure things got here on time. So when I say I’ve heard a change in tone I’m talking about a fairly dramatic shift.” As the 2020 election approaches the new postmaster general Louis DeJoy has prioritized budget cuts over getting people their mail on time. This could imperil voting by mail which is expected to happen at unprecedented levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. But for all the attention the public has paid to mail-in ballots a well-functioning USPS is equally critical to voting in person. Because U.S. elections are so decentralized — with thousands of localized rules deadlines ballots and precincts — the post office as a system that successfully connects the entire nation is a singularly important part. The mail is how most voters receive official confirmation of their registration and notices about their polling places. The mail is how ballots get from the printer’s office to those polling places and how those polling places are staffed. (Usually the last steps to becoming a poll worker involve receiving an official appointment by mail and responding by mail.) The mail has to achieve all of this on time. Just one missed deadline in a chain of deadlines — for registration notification ballot delivery — can disenfranchise a voter. The mail in other words helps run U.S. elections. And there are fears that this year it will fall down on the job. “This is the first time I’ve heard this tone around election mail” said Patrick who is an expert on best practices for voting by mail. “It’s a massive shift from the overall vision of ‘the mail must go through’ to ‘the mail can wait.’ The mail can’t wait. For many voters one day is too late.” Under previous postmasters the Postal Service literally moved mountains to make sure things got here on time. Tammy Patrick a senior adviser at the nonprofit Democracy Fund Voice This summer DeJoy exacerbated a massive slowdown in the mail by banning extra trips to deliver late mail and by implementing a confusing overtime policy that has left many mail-sorting facilities short-staffed and scrambling — all of which he justified by saying these actions would save the agency billions of dollars. The Postal Service’s head of elections sowed doubt about whether the post office would honor a longtime informal arrangement to deliver absentee ballots to voters as fast as possible no matter what postage rates states can afford to pay. The agency has since reassured states it would deliver election mail speedily and is assembling a task force to help states troubleshoot problems with voting by mail. But time is running out. Some states have already begun to mail ballots. To top it all off President Donald Trump has said he opposes more funding for the Postal Service because “that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting” something he clearly views as an impediment to his reelection. He has also encouraged his supporters to try to vote twice to test mail-in voting systems. “For years we’ve worked to establish an understanding at the agency of their role in delivering democracy for tens of millions of voters who have their ballot handed to them by a postal carrier and not a poll worker” Patrick said. For that dedication to break down now could cause a disaster. Behind-The-Scenes Rescues All told thousands of precincts across the country rely on millions of pieces of mail to arrive on time and to their proper destinations. During elections some local post offices cease to be simply a link in the chain and come to more closely resemble an arm of the election. Amber McReynolds recalled how in the 13 years she was the director of elections in Denver postal carriers and election officials coordinated so that election workers were ready to start counting absentee ballots the minute the post office had sorted them; there was never a wasted moment. McReynolds remembered at least two occasions when Denver didn’t have money to pay the Postal Service — someone in city hall had simply forgotten to refill the postal account — and yet the post office sent out huge shipments of election mail anyway so that it wouldn’t arrive late. Once that involved postcards that told voters their polling places; another time a giant booklet that explained Colorado and Denver’s ballot initiatives. “We had this amazing working relationship” McReynolds said. “They knew our birthdays and we brought them cookies.” It sounds silly McReynolds conceded but those relationships matter because local officials so rarely have all the resources they need to run elections smoothly. For example right now there are roughly 10000 different post office accounts set up by countless local election officials to pay for official election mail. Congress could establish a single account for the entire country to use as it does for election mail being sent to the U.S. Military. But Congress hasn’t and so sometimes the system has to run on generosity. Patrick has seen her fair share of close calls too. Over the years the printing companies that make absentee ballots have regularly printed envelopes with the wrong barcodes causing the USPS’s automatic sorting machines to send ballots to the wrong cities and counties. In most cases she said postal carriers have to step in and sort out the mess by hand. [The USPS] moved fast and got it done. There were stories of literally 20000 ballots pulling up in a truck on Election Day from the Postal Service. In the 2018 primary season the Postal Service saved the day when a truck carrying pallets of absentee ballots bound for Provo Utah broke down out of state. The printer was trucking ballots into Utah instead of mailing them from its factory to save on postage. The pallets showed up late on a Friday night unmarked and postal officials had to race around their sorting plant to identify the missing ballots and rush them out to voters. Within 24 hours every vote-by-mail voter in Provo had their ballot. “It wasn’t even their truck. It was their customer trying to save money” at the Postal Service’s expense said Patrick. “And yet it’s been that kind of commitment election officials have come to expect from the post office.” The USPS has already had to scramble to solve election crises created by the global pandemic. This April COVID-19 sickened nearly 400 postal workers at three mail sorting facilities in Detroit and delayed thousands of primary ballots bound for voters in northwest Ohio. After election officials got wind just a week before Ohio’s primary the USPS raced truckloads of ballots to its Ohio sorting plants and assigned overtime and investigators to make extra sweeps for ballots that had been left behind. “They moved fast and got it done” said someone involved in the election. “There were stories particularly in big counties of literally 20000 ballots pulling up in a truck on Election Day from the Postal Service.” But some officials who were instrumental in solving the problem no longer work at the agency or have been sidelined. One was David E. Williams who was reportedly swept out of day-to-day operations in August when DeJoy gave the agency a leadership shakeup. Another was Stroman the former second-in-command at USPS who offered to send postal carriers to hurricane shelters; he resigned in May. The post office does not always perform perfectly in a crisis. This spring in New York state officials abruptly relaxed the rules for voting absentee leading to a more than eightfold jump in absentee voters compared to the 2016 primary — 1.2 million versus 157000 — for which few were prepared. Hundreds of voters may have received ballots too late to vote. At a post office in Brooklyn workers failed to place a dated postmark on thousands of ballots causing the New York City Board of Elections to declare about 12500 ballots invalid (for votes to count they had to be postmarked on or before Election Day). Two congressional races went undecided for six weeks. Even this debacle though was not the incontrovertible failure of the mail that skeptics made it out to be. (A Wall Street Journal editorial approvingly quoted state officials who blamed the Postal Service and warned that November may bring “a mail-vote debacle the country might come to regret.”) The delay in getting ballots to voters had a lot to do with the fact that the deadline to request an absentee ballot was too close to Election Day. The night before the primary New York City elections officials dropped 30000 blank ballots in the mail. The post office raced them out the door and assigned workers to postmark by hand the thousands of completed ballots that would be arriving at the last minute. As for the ballots from Brooklyn that were missing postmarks a federal judge later ruled that the state must count most of them. Because 97% of those ballots arrived at the Board of Elections within two days of the primary the judge reasoned it was a fact that they had been mailed on or before Election Day. In other words the Postal Service had still performed its core function — delivering the mail — with enough reliability to make up for a cascade of other problems. Postal officials have promised to be just as dedicated in the general election. “We’re still going to do those things that we’ve done to try everything we can when we have a rescue situation to make that rescue happen. We are completely committed to doing these things” Justin Glass the director of the USPS’s election mail operations said at a recent panel on the coming election. “Our employees take pride in delivering for boards of elections when we have those issues and those things are going to continue.” The agency’s ability to assign overtime he added has not really been cut. “But what we’re looking at is it’s gotta be smart. We gotta have smart overtime.” Voting rights advocates say the post office has started working more closely with election officials to prepare for November leaving them more reassured. But they still find themselves on high alert and wondering if the agency has assigned enough staff behind the scenes for the task ahead. “It’s something we’re watching very closely those of us that have worked in this space for a long time” said McReynolds. “What is the post office’s plan to support election officials?” Calling all HuffPost superfans!

Trump changes story, says he wanted to assassinate Syria's Assad,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/trump-assassinate-syria-assad-415093,www.politico.com,1600223579509
"Let's [expletive] kill him! Let's go in. Let's kill the [expletive] lot of them" Trump is said to have told Mattis. According to the book Mattis acknowledged Trump's request but later turned to an aide and said he would not do "any of that." Following the book's publication Trump denied the account dismissing the book as "fiction" and telling journalists that assassinating Assad "was never contemplated nor would it be contemplated." In the Tuesday interview Trump personally attacked Mattis as "highly overrated" and "a bad leader" saying "he was terrible to me he was a terrible general." Trump also accused the retired Marine general of failing to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Iraq declared the ISIS caliphate defeated in 2017; the Pentagon said Kurdish troops supported by U.S. forces had routed the militant group in Syria in March 2019 several months after Mattis resigned. "I got rid of ISIS after he was gone. I did a great job on ISIS 100 percent of the caliphate got rid of them" Trump said.,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/trump-assassinate-syria-assad-415093,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Mormons rejected Trump as blasphemous. Now he likely can’t win without them.,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/13/trump-biden-mormons-church-412234,www.politico.com,1600223579509
“I don't understand how a member of the LDS Church could support somebody that is amoral and has shown his amorality from the time he came into our view” former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid a Democrat from Nevada and member of the church said in an interview. Trump’s campaign is hoping that more Mormons have gone the way of Lee and right-wing radio host Glenn Beck — erstwhile critics who’ve come to support Trump. In 2016 Democrats did not appear to convert many of the Mormons who voted against Trump. Some stayed home while many others cast a protest vote for the conservative LDS third-party candidate Evan McMullin who earned 21 percent of Utah’s vote. McMullin also received about 7 percent in neighboring Idaho but his support in Arizona was negligible because he was not listed on the ballot and was only a write-in candidate. Without McMullin in the race and with turnout expected to exceed that of 2016 both parties see a rare group of potentially persuadable voters at a very unpersuadable time. “Not having the third party ticket with Evan McMullin will help give us an opportunity to pull some of those voters into the Trump camp” McDaniel who is Romney’s niece said. McMullin who still opposes Trump said he thinks some of his supporters will vote for the president but that “most people who voted third party in 2016 will be supporting Biden in this election.” He argued that some Republicans voted for Trump “out of habit” but have since soured on him. A Biden official conceded that Trump will likely improve on his 2016 performance among Mormons but that the Democrat's goal is to significantly limit those gains. Some longtime LDS Democratic organizers said Biden has already improved on Hillary Clinton’s efforts which they said were too focused on Utah. “The Biden campaign seems much more aware of the Latter-day Saint diaspora in the Mountain West and the Atlantic South” said Rob Taber a national co-chair of LDS Dems. "It’s not going to be shocking that Trump wins the Mormon vote but if it’s 10 to 15 points off of the norm in Nevada and Arizona that’s a big deal" said Quin Monson a partner at the Utah-based polling firm Y2 Analytics and a political science professor at the Church-funded Brigham Young University. "It’s the equivalent of Republicans suddenly getting a quarter of the African American vote and I do think it’s within the realm of possibility. They've not come around completely on Donald Trump." So far the Trump campaign appears to be dedicating more of their candidates’ time to courting Mormon voters. While Pence visited Arizona there are no plans for Biden or his running mate Kamala Harris to participate in a Mormon-oriented event. Biden’s advisers believe his Roman Catholicism could also appeal to LDS voters but the campaign isn’t airing ads in Arizona focusing on his religion. Trump is trailing Biden by about 5 points in Arizona according to polling averages and LDS voters could be decisive if the race tightens. In 2018 Kyrsten Sinema won massive Maricopa County — which includes the historically Mormon suburb of Mesa — becoming the first Democrat to win an Arizona Senate seat since the 1980s. Trump's campaign advisers have said they don't see Maricopa County as a must-win; instead they’re looking to run up the president’s margins in rural Arizona. The LDS enclaves in the White Mountains will be key to that effort.,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/13/trump-biden-mormons-church-412234,www.politico.com,1600223579509

“Joe Biden in contrast comes prepared with plans to control COVID-19 improve health care reduce carbon emissions and restore the role of legitimate science in policy making. He solicits expertise and has turned that knowledge into solid policy proposals.” The editorial focuses much of its attention on the pandemic response and Trump’s repeated attempts to minimize the severity of the situation which has killed nearly 200000 Americans to date. “At every stage Trump has rejected the unmistakable lesson that controlling the disease not downplaying it is the path to economic reopening and recovery” editors wrote. The magazine's announcement comes a day after Biden and Trump shadowboxed from opposite ends of the country amid the ongoing wildfires that are raging along the West Coast. Trump traveled to California Monday to assess the situation and notably dismissed the state’s top natural resources official who raised the effect rising temperatures are having in exacerbating wildfires with the president saying “it’ll start getting cooler just watch.” The official Wade Crowfoot responded by saying “I don’t think the science agrees with you” to which Trump asserted the science was unsettled. Biden on Monday called the president a “climate arsonist” for not confronting the need for dramatic action to address climate change. “Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have caused these fires and record floods and record hurricanes but if he gets a second term these hellish events will continue to become more common more devastating and more deadly” Biden said on Monday. Scientific American praised Biden’s environmental and health care platform and while its unclear how much of it could make it through Congress if he were elected “he is acutely aware that we must heed the abundant research showing ways to recover from our present crises and successfully cope with future challenges.”,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/scientific-american-backs-biden-415132,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Trump crams policy moves,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/trump-policy-moves-final-weeks-415630,www.politico.com,1600223579509
The president is also still vaguely promising ill-defined developments on core voting issues like health care taxes and immigration after signing a flurry of executive orders in recent weeks on issues like drug pricing and temporary work visas. The tactic is now familiar for Trump: Throw out a bunch of policy offerings — real or not — in the runup to an election in the hopes something will stick. In 2018 he promised a tax cut proposal that never materialized and turned a “caravan” of migrants into a scare tactic that he dropped shortly after the election. Now it's a series of executive orders signing ceremonies and Twitter proclamations that are often oversold or appear micro-targeted to specific voting blocs. “There’s a concerted effort to make good on promises from the 2016 campaign trail as well as promises that have been made during President Trump’s first term in office” said Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller. “Many of these things we have coming up have taken years to put together or move along so this just happens to be when things are brought to completion.” Critics say the rapidity of announcements and the campaign’s eagerness to spin them into ads demonstrates the underlying political motivation. After Tuesday’s singing ceremony at the White House Halie Soifer the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America said “any opening between Israel and its neighbors is a positive thing” but added “there’s no denying this ceremony was driven by domestic politics for Donald Trump.” But Ralph Reed a top surrogate for the Trump campaign and the executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition a major social conservative group hailed the event as historic. “The fact that it plays well with some constituencies in no way diminishes the historic nature of the achievement or its potential to advance peace in the region” said Reed. There’s nothing new about incumbent presidents fast tracking policies or announcing diplomatic breakthroughs in the lead up to an election. In 1996 President Bill Clinton signed bipartisan welfare reform into law taking the policy issue off the table for Republicans. And in 1964 President Lyndon Johnson hoping to push back on criticism about his foreign policy credentials signed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which enabled Johnson’s use of military force in Vietnam and the Wilderness Act to help bolster his standing with conservationists. “Within a matter of weeks in 1964 you saw Johnson addressing two weak spots conservationists and the Roosevelt Republican world and foreign policy” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. “It’s an advantage that a sitting president has that they can create a dramatic backdrop for whatever they do.” Trump brought the presidential backdrop to Florida last week where he made a show of signing a moratorium on oil drilling off the coasts of Florida Georgia and South Carolina. The move gained kudos from Republicans in the tourism and real estate industries concerned about the potential impact offshore drilling could have on their businesses. Yet Trump was essentially reversing his own initiatives with the move: He vowed in 2018 to allow oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States coastal waters and just last month finalized plans to open up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas development. Trump has also rolled back Obama-era regulations on fossil fuels and exited the Paris Agreement on climate control measures two moves that environmental advocates say will damage the climate and increase pollution. Gina McCarthy head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama and now CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the move was a “transparent attempt to manipulate Floridians two months before Election Day.” Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates said "What families aren’t hearing from Donald Trump at these events is deafening: a coherent strategy to lift the country out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years and change the game for middle class families.” Officials say similar announcements are expected in the coming weeks although some might remain promises that never come to fruition. The president will also continue his rallies at airport hangars where Air Force One is always on display interspersed with official events at the White House that regularly include political attacks on Biden. Those events may focus on trying to show action on the Trump campaign promises that remain unfilled. Obamacare remains intact Trump’s congressional proposal to overhaul immigration laws has not moved and numerous “Infrastructure Weeks” never produced a substantial bill. Several long-touted policy roll-outs like Trump’s Obamacare replacement proposal have similarly blown through months of self-proclaimed deadlines. “Every September and October before the election you’re trying to do two things” said Brinkley. “Develop dirt on their opponent and showcase your presidency.”,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/trump-policy-moves-final-weeks-415630,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Oracle dodged the tech giant hot seat for years. The TikTok deal changes things.,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/oracle-tiktok-privacy-415043,www.politico.com,1600223579509
TikTok has faced rising scrutiny from officials in Washington over its efforts to safeguard user data and keep the millions of young kids and teens who use its platform safe. With Oracle's proposed partnership now under federal review lawmakers and advocates say Oracle should brace to face the same grillings as its new business ally. “They're inheriting some of these problems some of these issues and along with that they should expect to see increased scrutiny both from policymakers and politicians and also from advocates like us” said Josh Nelson campaigns director for ParentsTogether a children’s safety advocacy group. That would be a new position for Oracle which has dodged the hot seat in recent years as tech giants like Google Facebook Apple and Amazon have been repeatedly summoned to testify about their business practices on Capitol Hill. Oracle’s operations have not been particularly contentious in Washington focused on data management software supply chain tools and cloud systems. And the company has cultivated a powerful ally in recent years in President Donald Trump making it one of the only Silicon Valley giants to enter his good graces while in office. That’s offered Oracle a potential buffer against the same political pitfalls that have bedeviled its competitors. Meanwhile Oracle has helped fuel efforts to rein in rival tech companies. It’s funded groups to pare back the legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for users’ posts. And Oracle has lobbied regulators around the globe to scrutinize the privacy practices of its competitors including rival Google which it is separately set to face off against in the Supreme Court later this year over a protracted copyright dispute. Now with the TikTok deal still not finalized and the possibility that the Trump administration could still scramble the plan some are already turning up the heat on Oracle. “Oracle and ByteDance owe TikTok users a clear and immediate explanation about how their valuable videos and intimate personal data will be protected" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) a top privacy hawk said in a statement. "I want specific ironclad commitments on how Oracle and ByteDance will guarantee users’ privacy cyber security and freedom of expression.” ParentsTogether and other consumer groups in May called for federal regulators to launch an investigation into whether TikTok has continued to skirt children's online privacy laws after settling one such complaint for $5.7 million with the Federal Trade Commission in 2019. The company has also faced pressure from advocacy groups and lawmakers alike to crack down on child predators seeking to exploit the app to target its massive base of young users. Privacy advocates say Oracle now has a responsibility to address those issues and are already pushing for it and ByteDance to make additional commitments to beef up their privacy and security practices regardless of how the structure of the deal shakes out. "I’m watching the TikTok-Oracle transaction closely and it’s imperative that all of the players involved prioritize children’s privacy every step of the way" said Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) a top champion for children’s privacy on Capitol Hill. An Oracle spokesperson did not return a request to comment for this story. TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza said in an email: “The safety and well-being of our community remains our top priority as we build TikTok for the long term.” The company recently launched an online portal detailing its privacy security and content moderation practices which it said was designed “for experts and lawmakers to see first-hand how we're working to build a safe and secure platform.” The partnership with TikTok could also put Oracle in conflict with its own push for social media regulation in Washington. The company has both directly and indirectly lobbied to pare down a key set of legal protections that shield internet companies from lawsuits over the content they host. The protections afforded under a section of federal law known as Section 230 are considered crucial to companies like Facebook and Google-owned YouTube that host billions of user-generated posts and videos each year. But they’ve been targeted by Oracle and at least one advocacy group funded by Oracle whose core business until now hasn’t been as reliant on those protections as its competitors. In 2017 Oracle became one of the first major tech companies to back a bill to open internet companies up to liability if they knowingly enable sex trafficking on their services. The measure signed into law in 2018 was contested by the broader tech industry. Oracle separately also funded a dark money group that has lobbied aggressively for scaling back Section 230 according to Bloomberg. Now with Oracle poised to take a still-to-be-determined financial stake in a popular social media app that’s home to millions of user videos daily it could see its own legal exposure increase if those protections are pared back. “It’ll be really interesting to see if Oracle is consistent with their beliefs from three years ago or if now that it threatens their own bottom line they take a much different position” said Josh Golin executive director for the Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood another major children's safety advocacy group. The one trouble spot that Oracle and Bytedance are working to set aside definitively is any concern about entanglements with China. When President Donald Trump signed two executive orders in August aimed at forcing ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. business he cited concerns users' personal information on the app could fall into the hands of the Chinese government. TikTok has previously said it has walled off its data from that of its Chinese parent company and that it would not share information with the Chinese state. Even so TikTok said Monday it had reached a proposal that would "resolve the Administration's security concerns." Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told CNBC Monday that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. will review the proposal this week and make a recommendation to the president. In its statement Monday Oracle said it was ready to ensure the security of its users. “Oracle has a 40-year track record providing secure highly performant technology solutions" it said. The company has operated in China for years but in 2019 Oracle slashed its workforce in the country amid rising trade tensions between the U.S. government and Beijing. Oracle’s public coziness with the Trump administration could help smooth over regulatory concerns about TikTok’s China ties — Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison is one of a few tech moguls who have publicly embraced and even held fundraisers for Trump. But even if those concerns are settled advocacy groups say the spotlight will remain on Oracle and TikTok’s other practices. "TikTok is going to be ground zero for privacy hawks on the Hill concerned about the issue" said Jeff Chester executive director of the consumer group Center for Digital Democracy.,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/oracle-tiktok-privacy-415043,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Opinion | Trump’s TikTok Policy Is Just a New Kind of ‘Security Theater’,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/09/15/trumps-tiktok-policy-is-just-a-new-kind-of-security-theater-415088,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Instead it’s better to understand these actions as a form of security theater. Coercing TikTok is less a serious policy to protect American phones and data than it is a cousin of the elaborate Transportation Security Administration screening rituals that took root after 9/11: A way for Washington to look like it’s doing something to protect Americans against a global threat without bothering to do anything substantive to address challenges and mitigate harms. The order that TikTok be sold was predicated on the thin reed that it represented a threat to U.S. national security because of the possibility that the Chinese government could force TikTok to hand the Chinese government data on tens of millions of U.S. citizens. That is indeed a possibility but not one of any particular import. The Chinese government could order the company to provide access just as an American court can order an American tech company to turn over information on users though in the China case the data could be broader and less limited by legal constraints. Those constraints however are largely beside the point. If the Chinese government has an interest in a U.S. citizen’s data it has its own ways to obtain it unencumbered by a legal process just as the National Security Agency can and does globally. The invocation of U.S. national security as the pretext to ban TikTok is misleading to the point of absurdity. Social media apps do not present a rich target and if the Chinese government wanted to access user data it has ample cyberespionage tools to do so. So does any government that has invested heavily in cyberespionage which would include the United States Russia Israel and a handful of other countries. The targeting of foreign social media companies by the Trump administration will do little to protect the data sanctity of American citizens. But perhaps that isn’t the point. As a grand dramatic gesture the presumptive banning of TikTok — along with the simultaneous injunction on American companies doing business with Chinese messaging app WeChat which has less of a U.S. presence but is massive globally — allows the administration the simulacrum of toughness without necessitating the actual toughness of making hard decisions about real-world trade-offs. Neither service however wildly popular has much of an economic footprint in the United States. That’s in contrast to the multiyear American campaign against the Chinese telecom equipment company Huawei which has considerable business in the United States and Europe as a supplier of technology for 5G. Huawei was and is a bona fide supplier of vital telecommunications hardware but the struggle against it long predates the Trump administration and is part of a considered policy to deny state-allied Chinese companies a competitive advantage in the global telecom race. It may or may not be a smart or realistic strategy especially in the absence of an American alternative to some of its 5G equipment but it is at least an actual strategy. In terms of their ability to protect Americans the social media bans are the equivalent of the two years of tariffs instituted by Trump as part of his trade war: pinpricks that do little to alter the structural interdependence between China and the United States but do cause friction. There’s no signal the Trump administration is truly willing to undertake a multipronged assault on the China-U.S. economic intertwinement which would include allocating trillions of dollars to pay for reshoring and also compensate U.S. firms that would be imperiled if China chose to retaliate by shutting them out. (Who would manufacture a hundred million iPhones for example if China was willing to shut down production in Shenzhen?) That would be a real strategy fraught with challenges and risks requiring assiduous cultivation of alliances and massive domestic spending on top of the spending already demanded by the pandemics. It would be years of hard work with no guarantee that the end result would be a more secure and prosperous United States and a more constrained enfeebled China. It would in short be hard work with less fanfare and few photo ops. It would be real policy and not security theater. To be fair to Trump Americans—people and politicians—have a weakness for that theater. In the aftermath of 9/11 many of the measures taken by the TSA created the image of staunch measures to deter terrorism: the patting down the scans the random swabs to detect chemical explosives. As so many experts pointed out for years those moves may have made flying a bit safer but in actuality it was the far cheaper less disruptive practice of reinforcing cockpit doors that prevented anyone from again turning an airplane into a guided missile. And then there was the very fact of the TSA itself: newly named placed in a newly invented agency called the Department of Homeland Security all designed to say to the citizenry “You are safe.” If the current extent of security theater was just the inconvenience for millions of teens needing a new app to watch highly creative and semi-addictive short videos then perhaps we could shrug this off as silly but inconsequential. But of course it’s not: The security theater around terrorism has been profoundly wasteful and new theater arising around Covid-19 could well create its own expensive bureaucracy without any particular health benefit. The big one right now appears to be the temperature-check regime being implemented for office buildings schools and international flights which even the nation’s top infectious disease doctor has called basically pointless. We know that many people carry Covid and are asymptomatic and that many others are contagious before showing symptoms. These protocols create the impression of doing something even as that something largely does nothing. Thankfully the responses to Covid transcend these empty protocols but the fact of them speaks to a continued reliance of American policy on things one can see and point to rather than the hard work of designing comprehensive approaches that demand a real consideration of costs benefits and trade-offs. The Trump administration is particularly susceptible but hardly unique in its addiction to form over much substance. Obama’s wind-farm ban might have had a security purpose but it also had a political purpose since his rival Mitt Romney had been attacking him for softness on China. The absence of a China-owned TikTok will not suddenly hobble the ability of the Chinese government to hoover the data of American citizens any more than having no Facebook in China prevents the American NSA from spying on the Chinese. In substituting theater for substance they all have a cost not just in time but in precluding more concerted more difficult and more comprehensive measures. It will be lovely when we can all go to an actual theater once again; it will be even better when we end our collective addiction to this kind of performance.,body,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/09/15/trumps-tiktok-policy-is-just-a-new-kind-of-security-theater-415088,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Climate clash hits 2020 race as California burns,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/biden-trump-california-fires-climate-change-414753,www.politico.com,1600223579509
While Biden and Trump’s divergent attitudes toward climate change were already well established their comments on Monday only stood to underscore their differences on an issue that has put lives at stake. The showdown came as historic wildfires have displaced tens of thousands of residents up and down the West Coast tinged the sky a red-orange hue and created some of the world’s worst air quality in parts of California. At least 35 people are dead across California Oregon and Washington and more than 3 million acres of land have been scorched. In remarks from Wilmington Del. the former vice president pitched himself as the only choice to combat climate change shortly ahead of Trump’s first visit to view the damage in California from the fires that have been raging for weeks. “If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House why would anyone be surprised if we have more America ablaze?” Biden said. “If you give a climate denier four more years in the White House why would anyone be surprised when more of America is underwater?” Trump faced a more direct confrontation at his event here in California’s capital from Gov. Gavin Newsom and Wade Crowfoot the head of the state’s Natural Resources Agency. “I think we want to work with you to really recognize the changing climate and what it means for our forests and actually work together with that science” Crowfoot told the president at the wildfire briefing which featured local and federal officials involved in combating the fires. Crowfoot emphasized to the president that “science is going to be key.” While he applauded Trump’s focus on forest management as a method of controlling and fighting wildfires Crowfoot warned Trump not to “ignore” the science of climate change arguing that it would be misguided to “sort of put our heads in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management” a course of action he said would not ultimately protect Californians. Trump however pushed back on Crowfoot’s assessment telling the secretary that “it’ll start getting cooler just watch.” “I don’t think the science agrees with you” Crowfoot responded to which Trump countered: “I don’t think science knows actually.” After the briefing Crawfoot fired back at the president on Twitter posting a graph of California’s average temperature from June to September with a trendline showing that figure steadily increasing over the last four decades. “It actually won’t get cooler Mr. President. #ClimateChangeIsReal” Crowfoot wrote. Newsom a Democrat with whom Trump has had a hot-and-cold relationship also challenged the president on his views even as he acknowledged that Trump was unlikely to change them. “I’d be negligent and this is not — we’ve known each other too long and as you suggest the working relationship I value” he told the president. “We obviously feel very strongly that the hots are getting hotter the dries are getting drier.” “Something’s happened to the plumbing of the world and we come from a perspective humbly where we submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident that climate change is real and that is exacerbating this” he continued urging Trump to “please respect the difference of opinion out here with respect to this fundamental issue of climate change.” “Absolutely” the president responded. Climate change is playing a role in the severity of the fires which are expected to increase in frequency in future years. The U.S. endured its fourth-hottest summer ever recorded amid an abnormally dry season according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That helped create the volatile conditions on the heels of the nation’s sixth-warmest winter as lightning strikes ignited West Coast blazes even before official wildfire season began. “Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have caused these fires and record floods and record hurricanes but if he gets a second term these hellish events will continue to become more common more devastating and more deadly” Biden said on Monday. Biden laid out the consequences of climate change along the nation’s coasts and in suburbs pointing to the health concerns stemming from wildfires and other natural disasters that disproportionately affect communities of color as well as the massive costs to the economy and the national security threats posed by sea-level rise. “With every bout of nature’s fury caused by our own inaction on climate change more Americans see and feel the devastation whether they’re in big cities small towns on coastlines or farm lands” Biden said. “It’s happening everywhere and it’s happening now and it affects us all.” Biden also took aim at Trump’s central campaign theme on law and order using the same phrasing he has employed when criticizing Trump’s response to the protests that swept across the country to attack him on his lack of action on climate change. “It’s clear that we’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America” Biden said. “This is Donald Trump’s America. He’s in charge.” Trump has also warned that immigration is threatening U.S. suburbs an assertion that Biden called “ridiculous” in his remarks. “You know what is actually threatening our suburbs?” he said “Wildfires are burning the suburbs of the West. Floods are wiping out suburban neighbors in the Midwest. Hurricanes are imperiling suburban life along our coast. If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial how many suburbs will be burned by wildfires? How many suburban neighborhoods will be flooded out? How many suburbs will have been blown away by superstorms?” Biden positioned Trump’s policies and actions as “backward-looking politics” that will stand to harm the environment make communities less healthy and hold back economic progress. “It’s a mindset that doesn’t have any faith in the capacity of the American people to compete to innovate and to win” Biden said pointing instead to his own climate plan which calls for making buildings more energy-efficient boosting clean-energy jobs and expanding electric transportation. “We have to act as a nation” Biden said. “It shouldn’t be so bad that millions of Americans live in the shadow of an orange sky and are left asking ‘Is Doomsday here?’”,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/biden-trump-california-fires-climate-change-414753,www.politico.com,1600223579509
‘They made a really big mistake’: Biden confronts a regret of the Obama years,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/biden-economics-obama-stimulus-414869,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Should Biden take the White House and get a Democratic Senate it will likely all translate into an immediate push to roll back President Donald Trump’s corporate tax cuts slap significantly higher taxes on wealthy Americans and push through a multitrillion-dollar stimulus spending package aimed at fighting the Covid-19 virus sending cash directly into people’s pockets renewing enhanced unemployment benefits rescuing struggling state budgets and investing in new infrastructure projects. Joe Biden is putting together a plan for getting the economy out of a pandemic-sized ditch ahead of the November election — and it’s shaping up to include a whole lotta spending. “The magnitude of the crisis in 2008 was enormous but this time we’ve got multiple overlapping crises” said Jake Sullivan the Biden campaign’s senior policy adviser who served in a similar role for Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. “As a result the sense of possibility in both policy terms and political terms is big both in the scope of the agenda and the size of the investments the vice president wants to make.” In Obama’s early years in the White House liberals complained about the influence of some of his more center-left advisers including former Treasury Secretaries Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner. Some progressives spent years criticizing Obama for decisions they saw as too friendly to Wall Street. They also saw Obama’s roughly $800 billion stimulus package as too small to address the scope of the Great Recession a mistake they say helped lead to years of slow growth — for which Obama and Biden are still getting hammered politically — and increasing income inequality. Defenders of the stimulus say it largely worked to end the recession and that the White House faced constraints on size forced on them by the Senate. But they acknowledge that state and local job losses and other budget cuts were among the problems that sapped the recovery for years — a point House Democrats have maintained as a top-of-mind concern this year. Whatever the case Biden’s group of internal and external advisers leans decidedly more to the left of Obama’s and includes Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) left-leaning economists Heather Boushey Lisa Cook Raj Chetty William Spriggs and Jared Bernstein all of whom support bold tax and spending policy to fulfill the former vice president's pledge to create “most progressive administration” since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The broad economic advisory group is not totally dominated by hardcore liberals. Gene Sperling who served in both the Obama and Bill Clinton administrations is also an important voice in Biden’s ear as is Jeff Zients who served as Obama’s National Economic Council director and is now a co-chair of the Democratic nominee’s transition team. Zients is a wealthy investor with deep business ties giving the campaign the ability to reassure corporate America that their concerns won’t go entirely unaddressed. Ben Harris who also served as Biden’s top economic adviser in the Obama White House is also said to be a somewhat more moderate voice with experience in the financial industry. But even people like Sperling have trended left in recent years — though they may stop short of pushing Medicare for All. Biden also talks to Summers who has moved decidedly to the left since serving in the White House. The former Clinton Treasury secretary and Obama NEC director has become less concerned with deficits given structural problems in an economy that has tilted most of its gains toward the upper end of the income spectrum in recent years. Covid-19 has only worsened that problem for blue-collar workers who don’t have the luxury of working from home like many high-earning white-collar workers. Biden and his advisers have avoided putting a dollar figure on the size of the stimulus the former vice president would seek if he wins. Some of it depends on whether Congress approves any further spending this year on top of the nearly $4 trillion already approved to fight the economic devastation wrought by Covid-19 which led to the biggest quarterly economic decline on record and has left nearly 30 million people still receiving some type of unemployment assistance. Biden told POLITICO earlier this year that he wanted a package “a hell of a lot bigger” than the initial $2 trillion CARES Act. He is said by close advisers to be deeply concerned with economic “scarring” from the Covid-19 crisis meaning lasting impacts on younger workers if they can’t quickly return to the labor force and begin forming households. Many of these lessons stem from the grinding nature of the recovery from the Great Recession. In a recent interview Bernstein suggested that if he wins Biden is anticipating an economy still operating well below potential — the so-called “output gap” — and in desperate need of massive federal intervention. “Every forecast I've seen including my own suggests that the output gap and the unemployment rate will be very high at the beginning of next year” he said. “I'm not going to give a number in terms of trillions but it would need to be definitely very significant in the spirit of the magnitudes of the bills we've seen so far.” And Biden will come under immediate pressure from the left if he wins and Democrats take the Senate to go as big as possible on stimulus spending tax hikes on the wealthiest and new regulations on Wall Street. Progressives are already concerned about some of Biden’s comments suggesting a concern about long-term deficits and paying for spending bills. “The idea that the U.S. faces any major risk from our debt burden is simply wrong” said Dean Baker senior economist at the Center for Economic Policy and Research and a frequent critic of the size of Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill. “If for some reason private investors became more reluctant to hold U.S. debt the Fed could simply step in and buy it. If the U.S. is struggling to recover from this recession there is no reason to be concerned about running large deficits.” Baker added that he was pleased for the most part with the makeup of Biden’s economic advisory team and suggested that any stimulus bill should be around 4 to 5 percent of annual GDP or around $1 trillion per year. “As a group these people are pretty progressive and at the very least they will have his ear. Whether they carry the day in arguments or not who knows” Baker said. “But Biden was there under Obama and I think he recognizes what is universally recognized among Democrats that they made a really big mistake in not getting more.” POLITICO NEWSLETTERS Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street — weekday mornings in your inbox. Biden last week also said that boosting the corporate tax rate would be among his first acts as president. “I'd make the changes on the corporate taxes on day one. The reason I'd make the change on corporate taxes is it could raise $1.3 trillion if they just start paying at 28 percent instead of 21 percent” he said on CNN. “What are they doing? They're not hiring more people. What are they doing? They are buying back their own stock.” In addition to a large stimulus and an increase in the corporate tax rate Biden has pledged to dismantle the Trump tax cut that took effect in 2018 instituting higher marginal rates on individuals with incomes over $400000. “I’m going to get rid of the bulk of Trump’s $2 trillion tax cut” Biden told wealthy donors in June. “And a lot of you may not like that but I’m going to close loopholes like capital gains and stepped-up basis.” Biden’s pledges to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations have not hit his fundraising ability. The campaign and the Democratic National Committee raised a record-shattering $365 million in August blowing away the $210 million raised by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. He’s also essentially erased Trump’s advantage on the economy as an issue in the last several months. Several polls show the two candidates tied on an issue where Trump enjoyed double-digit advantages in the spring. Biden is also trying to cut into Trump’s 2016 numbers among Midwestern blue-collar workers with a plan to impose higher taxes on companies’ foreign profits and offer tax breaks for domestic manufacturers. And the Democratic nominee does not plan to shy away from hammering a message of boosting taxes on high earners and big companies despite Trump’s constant attacks that Biden’s approach would tank the stock market and kill the economy. The Biden campaign is well aware of polling data suggesting Americans overwhelmingly support such higher taxes and the numbers have only risen since Covid-19 slammed blue-collar workers especially hard. Of course all of Biden’s big plans for taxes and spending depend on Democrats controlling all of Congress and perhaps jettisoning the legislative filibuster a dramatic move that would mean needing only 51 votes in the Senate to move major spending bills beyond tax legislation. “People recognize that we are going to need a significant magnitude of investment” said Sullivan Biden’s policy adviser. “That’s not to say the GOP wouldn’t try and resist and all of a sudden put on their green eyeshades again on spending. But the realities today in terms of what can be invested to get back to full employment are just different than they were back in 2009.”,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/biden-economics-obama-stimulus-414869,www.politico.com,1600223579509
‘This is f---ing crazy’: Florida Latinos swamped by wild conspiracy theories,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/florida-latinos-disinformation-413923,www.politico.com,1600223579509
At the same time there has been a rise of Spanish-language conservative media especially revolving around politics connected to Colombia and Venezuela that are increasingly showing up in the social media feeds of South Florida’s Latin America diaspora communities. They’re finding common cause with Cuban-Americans who dominate Spanish-language radio airwaves and have been a bulwark of Republican support in Florida’s otherwise Democratic-leaning and diverse Hispanic communities. But where radio is easy to hear for all Facebook is harder to track. And the encrypted messaging system it bought WhatsApp is even more difficult. WhatsApp group chats are widely popular among Latin Americans and other immigrant communities in the U.S. because the app doesn't require a U.S. phone number or specific mobile service provider making it easy to stay in touch with family abroad via text or voice communication. Group chats within the closed network can easily be created with dozens of people anywhere in the world. Plus iPhones aren’t as popular in Latin America — meaning iMessage chats are not an option for many. Political campaigns social justice movements and support groups have followed along making WhatsApp a top tool for reaching voters in Latin America and from Latin America. In South Florida veteran Latino Democratic strategist Evelyn Pérez-Verdia noticed this summer that the WhatsApp groups dedicated to updates on the pandemic and news for the Colombian and Venezuelan communities became intermittently interspersed with conspiracy theories from videos of far-right commentators or news clips from new Spanish-language sites like Noticias 24 and PanAm Post and the YouTube-based Informativo G24 website. “I’ve never seen this level of disinformation conspiracy theories and lies” Pérez-Verdia who is of Colombian descent said. “It looks as if it has to be coordinated.” Republicans say people on both sides of the political aisle are sharing disinformation organically although they can’t point to similar conspiracy theories espoused by the left. And they accuse Democrats of labeling every opinion or news story they disagree with as disinformation. For instance in a Covid WhatsApp chat group a Republican posted a statement that real Catholics can’t be Democrats which Pérez-Verdia found objectionable. But the group chat’s founder and administrator businessman and former Republican Miami-Dade County Commission candidate Alfred Santamaria said he didn’t ban the comment because he believed people should have freedom of expression. Our must-read briefing on what’s hot crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State. Still Santamaria conceded political toxicity is rising on the platform. “I see more tension more fighting more radicalism. I see a level of tension of people posting for and against the administration” he said. Some of the information shared in chat groups and pulled from YouTube and Facebook goes beyond hyperbolic and caustic rhetoric. On Informativo G24 longtime Colombian news anchor Sandra Valencia brings on guests via webcam for discussions about Latin America and U.S. politics with analysis that often relies on conspiracy theories such as how Black Lives Matter and other activist groups are planning a “siege” on the White House later this month. The site does not detail who funds it but asks supporters to donate to a PayPal account registered to Valencia. Valencia bills her Spanish-language YouTube page which has more than 378000 followers as a channel for geopolitical analysis. But it often resembles English-language right-wing news sources such as Infowars sharing conspiracy theories and strong anti-globalization messages. And unlike the conspiracy theories that circulate in English-language news media and social media there’s relatively little to no Spanish-language media coverage of the phenomenon nor a political counterpunch from the left. Some of the disinformation discussed on Informativo G24 has been led by Omar Bula-Escobar a former United Nations representative and Colombian geopolitical analyst who in recent years has become a frequent guest on various Latin American radio and television news shows to talk about globalization. Bula-Escobar who’s also a frequent guest on Miami-based Radio Caracol — which is one of Colombia’s main radio networks and widely respected throughout Latin America — has gained an increasing amount of notoriety for pushing the claim often seen as anti-Semitic that billionaire George Soros is “the world’s biggest puppet master” and is the face of the American Democratic Party. “Who’s going to celebrate the day God forbid Trump loses? Cuba; ISIS which Trump ended; Hezbollah which Obama gave the greenlight to enter Latin America; Iran; China … All the filth of the planet is against Donald Trump. So if you want to be part of the filth then go with the filth” Bula-Escobar said in a recent episode of Informativo G24. Other shared content has included a translated clip of Christian conservative pastor John MacArthur claiming there is no pandemic and coronavirus death numbers have been wildly exaggerated. In June a Noticias 24 a Venezuela-focused news site that has a large following in Latin America amplified disinformation with a story bearing the headline “social networks also accuse Joe Biden of being a pedophile.” A month later when the lie resurfaced “#BidenPedofilio” trended in Spain. On Facebook a Puerto Rican-born pastor Melvin Moya has circulated a video titled “Signs of pedophilia” with doctored videos of Biden inappropriately touching girls at various public ceremonies to a song in the background that says “I sniffed a girl and I liked it.” The fake video posted on Sept. 1 has received more than 33000 likes and 2400 comments. Much of the shared content cannot be traced to a specific campaign or political organization. Still fake videos and news stories are being widely shared in Facebook groups offering support for Trump. And various fake stories across WhatsApp and Facebook claim that Nicolás Maduro’s socialist party in Venezuela and U.S. communist leaders are backing Biden. “It’s really just a free-for-all now” said Raúl Martínez a Democrat who served as mayor of the largely conservative heavily Cuban-American city of Hialeah for 24 years and is now host of a daily radio show on Radio Caracol. “It’s mind boggling. I started in politics when I was 20. I’ve never seen it like this.” Martínez 71 said it has been particularly frustrating to see the prevalence of disinformation in South Florida Spanish-language stations which many older Latinos in the area still rely on for information. “When I hear from other stations they haven’t just sipped the Kool-Aid. They drank the whole thing” Martínez said. Radio Caracol for its part received unwelcome attention Aug. 22 when it aired 16 minutes of paid programming from a local businesssman who launched into an anti-Black and anti-Semitic rant that claimed a Biden victory would mean that the U.S. would fall into a dictatorship led by “Jews and Blacks.” The commentator claimed that Biden is leading a political revolution “directed by racial minorities atheists and anti-Christians” and supports killing newborn babies. When Miami state Sen. Annette Taddeo a Colombian-American who is also Jewish heard the programming she quickly called out the station on Twitter for “the disgusting message spoken by Trump supporters” adding that “We all — regardless of parties — have an obligation to repudiate and condemn this pro-Nazi and racist discourse.” However the 16-minute program did not receive coverage from local media outlets despite the outwardly racist and xenophobic messaging a reminder that much of the Spanish-language disinformation and conspiracy theories circulating in South Florida remain unchecked. Caracol management promptly apologized for the content and said it banned the commentator local businessman Jorge Gonzalez from the airwaves. A Caracol spokesman said Gonzalez had initially purchased the radio time to talk about business not politics let alone racist politics. Gonzalez couldn’t be reached for comment. Then on Friday the editor of the Spanish-language sister paper of The Miami Herald El Nuevo Herald publicly apologized for its own paid-media scandal after running a publication called “Libre” as a newspaper insert that attacked Black Lives Matter and trafficked in anti-Semitic views. "What kind of people are these Jews? They're always talking about the Holocaust but have they already forgotten Kristallnacht when Nazi thugs rampaged through Jewish shops all over Germany? So do the BLM and Antifa only the Nazis didn't steal; they only destroyed” the ad insert said. The publication said it's suspending its relationship with Libre. Conspiracy theories — especially revolving around QAnon which posits that Trump is fighting a global cabal of satanic pedophiles — are spreading across Spanish-language radio in Miami as well said Roberto Tejera a political independent who has a show on Actualidad Radio. Tejera said QAnon is a constant on another station La Poderosa whose station management also did not respond to messages seeking comment. “It’s not right wing. I don’t have a problem with right-wing stuff. It’s QAnon stuff. This is conspiracy theory. This goes beyond. This is new. This is a new phenomenon in Spanish speaking radio. We Cubans are not normal” Tejera laughed “but this is new. This is crazy. This is f---ing crazy.”,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/florida-latinos-disinformation-413923,www.politico.com,1600223579509

Jason Crow (D-Colo.) who flipped a GOP seat in 2018.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) the highly influential freshman lawmaker also said she has wrestled with the issue even as she has seen the pandemic’s devastating influence back home. “This administration it seems what they want to do is cut another $1200 check but they don’t want to actually provide state and local [aid]” Ocasio-Cortez said. “That $1200 is a nice little sugar high and I support giving another stimulus check but a second check in and of itself alone — if we’re not going to support state and local funding if it’s not going to include significant investments in testing tracing capacity and infrastructure — all it is is a little sugar high. It’s not going to solve the critical issues of the pandemic.” The sentiment from Ocasio-Cortez and others reflects the mounting angst within the Democratic Caucus over the party’s handling of the coronavirus response and whether they need to do more to counteract the GOP’s messaging. The House passed a $3.4 trillion relief package in May but the Senate didn’t act on it. Some Democrats worry that voters have already long forgotten about the House’s massive relief package from May and will take their anger out on both parties in November. They say that voting on additional bills could help remind people back home that Democrats have been pushing to deliver more aid all along. “Let’s make sure the American people know what we stand for and where we are” Rep. Greg Meeks (D-N.Y.) said. One idea Meeks said is to build out a new proposal to reflect the roughly $2 trillion price tag that Pelosi has described as the lowest figure Democrats would be willing to accept. “I think we can reemphasize what we’re doing and how we’re intent on spending the money and even where we made some reductions” Meeks said. But Pelosi has roundly resisted calls from some Democrats to negotiate a smaller coronavirus deal or put targeted bills on the floor addressing specific aspects of the pandemic including testing unemployment aid and small business loans. Talks between Pelosi and the White House led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been stalled for weeks even as the coronavirus continues to devastate the U.S. economy leaving millions without jobs and at risk of losing their homes. More than 6.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus and more than 194000 have died. Senate Democrats blocked the GOP's attempt to advance a “skinny” $500 billion coronavirus relief bill last week leaving senators in both parties — including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell himself — to speculate that congressional leaders wouldn’t get another coronavirus deal until after the election. That prospect however has alarmed many House moderates particularly those facing tough races in November. Some led by the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus have drafted their own long-shot compromise in an attempt to pry loose some kind of deal before November. That group released a roughly $2 trillion plan on Tuesday that would renew now-expired programs like unemployment aid and small business loans though it also includes billions in spending that Senate Republicans have already rejected like cash for state and local governments or the U.S. Postal Service. Pelosi has indicated she would negotiate a $2.2 trillion package with Republicans but hasn't been open to going below that number. Pelosi didn’t address the Problem Solvers plan during Tuesday’s caucus call but her position was made clear later in the day when several of her committee chairmen put out a joint statement dismissing the plan as falling “short of what is needed.” Some of those same allies including House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) also defended Pelosi’s strategy on the caucus call Tuesday. “For us not to cave in is really important” Neal said on the call according to Democrats who dialed in. But not everyone was in agreement. House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) did not sign onto the joint statement. And he said on the caucus call it was clear Democrats would have to address the coronavirus again before going home for the election noting it’s been four months since the House passed its $3.4 trillion relief bill. “We can’t leave town without a package” DeFazio said stressing Democrats pass a bill that will provide coronavirus aid at least until early next year when there might be a Democratic president in the White House. “We need to talk about all of our principles in a five month bill.”,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/nancy-pelosi-house-coronavirus-deal-415112,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Biden campaign manager boasts of a 'far more expanded map' to the White House,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/biden-campaign-electoral-map-415282,www.politico.com,1600223579509
While she conceded that the race has tightened over the past month or so O’Malley Dillon insisted the campaign had expected what once was a commanding lead for Biden to shrink some attributing the shift to this year’s electorate being more polarized than in 2016 with less of a pull toward third party candidates. “We have a far more expanded map” she concluded and “we are playing that.” In a Playbook interview last month Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien also asserted that Trump's campaign has multiple pathways to victory in November. “We have a quiet confidence based on our pathway” Stepien said stressing the need for “optionality.” “I’m asked all the time how are you going to run the table in the Upper Midwest again? He just has to win one of three” he continued pointing out that Trump “won with 306 electoral votes not 270 not on the button. We have some cushion there. But O’Malley Dillon contended that Trump’s campaign is not as well-positioned as the president frequently boasts arguing that despite campaigning in Nevada this week and a pledge to win New Hampshire Trump is “not playing heavily” in either state and his campaign is “doubling down” in states like Georgia and North Carolina. While Stepien said the Trump campaign views “near misses” in 2016 in states like New Hampshire and Minnesota as potential pickups O’Malley Dillon argued that goal has not translated financially. "There's so much work to be done we have to earn every vote but we feel very confident that we have an expanded map here and multiple pathways to 270 and the resources to be able to execute on that strategy" she said.,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/biden-campaign-electoral-map-415282,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Toxic intel feud dooms pre-election hearing on global threats,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/election-2020-threats-congress-415525,www.politico.com,1600223579509
“The worldwide threats hearing less than 50 days before a presidential election I’m not sure that that timing is particularly good” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and of GOP leadership. “But I would be very concerned if they stopped coming up and talking to the Intelligence Committee.” The public isn’t going to be completely in the dark. Some top administration officials including FBI Director Christopher Wray are slated to appear Thursday before the House Homeland Security Committee to offer testimony on national security threats. But the failure to get intelligence leaders before the historically nonpartisan Senate Intelligence Committee is a blow to efforts to inform the public and marks the latest in a series of norms tossed aside amid an increasingly pointed feud between the Trump administration’s intelligence officials and their overseers in Congress. Sen. Marco Rubio the acting chairman of the Intelligence Committee said the annual global threats hearing should “always” take place. | Andrew Harnik Pool/AP Photo In recent weeks Ratcliffe has significantly scaled back in-person election security briefings for lawmakers as Democrats have pressed the Trump administration for additional disclosures on foreign threats to the 2020 election. A public hearing would be one of the best ways to elicit that information especially as President Donald Trump and his allies continue to emphasize influence campaigns by Iran and China rather than Russia — even though intelligence officials say the Kremlin poses the most acute threat to the election. Meanwhile a Department of Homeland Security whistleblower has alleged that intelligence reports on Russian interference have been manipulated and suppressed for political reasons — prompting both the House and Senate intelligence panels to investigate. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) the acting chairman of the Intelligence Committee said the annual global threats hearing should “always” take place and said he is still working to iron out a date and time with the intelligence chiefs. Typically the hearings take place between February and May. He also dismissed the upcoming House hearing because that committee has jurisdiction over separate matters and is not hosting all of the intelligence chiefs. But Rubio who has lately lamented the breakdown of the committee’s oversight process due to increased politicization and once expressed doubt that a threats hearing would take place this year said he wasn’t worried about holding the hearing so close to the election. “It would be preferable to do it before the election but we need to have one” Rubio said. Rubio and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) the Intelligence Committee’s vice chairman had pushed Ratcliffe to publicly testify about global threats before Congress’ month-long summer recess and ahead of the final leg of the 2020 campaign. The spy chief later offered to appear in August but limit his remarks to an opening statement before moving the session behind closed doors. That would ensure Ratcliffe wouldn’t have to answer questions from senators that could be turned into cable-news clips if he contradicted Trump’s public claims as happened when intelligence chief Dan Coats testified last year. The proposal was rejected by Rubio and Warner according to two sources familiar with the negotiations. The back-and-forth underscores the Intelligence Committee’s months-long struggle to secure a worldwide threats hearing even after Ratcliffe committed during his confirmation hearing in May that he would appear at one. A spokeswoman for Ratcliffe reiterated his pledge but referred to letters he wrote last month to both Intelligence committees in which he said he would only answer questions in “closed sessions.” Democrats have argued that Trump and Ratcliffe are trying to downplay the threat of Russian meddling which the intelligence community has said is again intended to boost Trump. Republicans have countered that Democrats are trying to weaponize the Russia-related intelligence against the president. Ratcliffe and the other intelligence chiefs would almost certainly face a grilling from the committee over everything from election interference to North Korea’s nuclear program as well as the coronavirus pandemic and efforts by senior officials to portray China and Iran as greater threats to the integrity of the election. The House Intelligence Committee meanwhile hasn’t held a public worldwide threats hearing since 2016 because of the administration’s resistance. The panel is looking to change that by including language in its annual intelligence bill requiring the DNI to submit an annual worldwide threats assessment and then appear for a public session. Like Rubio Warner is trying to remain optimistic about ultimately holding a hearing despite the clandestine community’s reluctance — and even as many lawmakers acknowledge that it may be too late to arm Americans with clear and reliable information about foreign interference in the 2020 election. “I have not thrown in the towel” Warner said in an interview. “We have both worldwide threats and the absolute need for election security briefs. So there are two separate paths and Sen. Rubio and I are working on both of those.” Pressed on the dwindling number of legislative workdays left on the calendar Warner replied: “You have an amazing grasp of the obvious.”,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/election-2020-threats-congress-415525,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Biden campaign manager on Trump's return to rallies: 'People will die',headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/biden-campaign-manager-trump-rallies-415241,www.politico.com,1600223579509
She added that she was “horrified” to see pictures from the day before of about 100 Trump supporters packed into a ballroom in Arizona mostly maskless for an event billed as a roundtable by a campaign. “People will die because of these types of events and that's from the president of the United States” she asserted. “And you look at folks that might not be wearing masks or aren't taking this seriously and you understand how that’s the case.” Despite Biden generally approving of the diplomatic breakthrough being commemorated at the White House on Tuesday she said Trump “continues to just suggest that we aren't in the middle of a pandemic and it’s really problematic but so emblematic of his lack of leadership and what we are going to continue to stay focused on.” The president began holding rallies again in June when he sought to pack a Tulsa Okla. arena with supporters who his campaign required to agree wouldn’t sue the campaign if they contracted coronavirus at the event. A few weeks later the county saw a spike in cases that the head of the city’s health department said were “more than likely” connected to the rally and recent protests. Less than two weeks after attending the Tulsa rally and being photographed with no mask on Herman Cain one of Trump’s top Black surrogates was hospitalized with coronavirus though it is unknown where he contracted the virus. He died from complications with Covid-19 several weeks later. The Trump campaign has repeatedly defended its resumption of campaign rallies amid the pandemic with thousands of fans packing airplane hangars for the events in recent weeks mostly eschewing safety precautions like masks and physical distancing. The campaign has argued that it is a voter’s choice to attend Trump’s rallies — which O’Malley Dillon described as “superspreader” events for the coronavirus — and that rallygoers are offered free hand sanitizer and face masks and required to have their temperatures checked. Biden on the other hand has been criticized for his relatively light campaign schedule throughout the pandemic opting for entirely virtual events up until the last month or so. He has since resumed campaign traveling with smaller events where masks and social distancing are ubiquitous. While the former vice president has been ridiculed by Trump and his allies who have joked that Biden is “stuck in his basement” O’Malley Dillon embraced the two candidates’ differing pandemic campaign styles. "I think that contrast between how the vice president is approaching campaigning in a pandemic versus Donald Trump is stark and is certainly part and parcel to the leadership difference here” she said noting that the campaign is “very comfortable that we're reaching out to voters we’re having the conversation we need to have with voters” without putting them Biden or his staff in harm’s way.,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/biden-campaign-manager-trump-rallies-415241,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Monmouth poll: Biden up 5 points on Trump in Florida,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/monmouth-biden-up-5-points-on-trump-in-florida-415199,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Trump holds a substantial lead over Biden among white voters 56-39 percent. However Trump won the same group by more than 30 points in 2016 and Biden’s support in central Florida and areas outside of Democrats’ traditional strongholds in the southern part of the state is stronger than Clinton’s was in 2016. “The current picture has Biden maintaining a typical Democratic advantage in southern Florida while making notable inroads in other parts of the state” Monmouth polling director Patrick Murray said in a release. One major warning sign for the president is the level of support among military voters where Trump has a 4-point lead over Biden among veterans and those in military households. However among all survey respondents a larger percentage — 70 percent — said that Biden respects the military and veterans compared to just 56 percent for Trump. The poll was conducted shortly after an explosive report in The Atlantic parts of which were subsequently backed up by other outlets that detailed accusations of Trump belittling top military officers and denigrating soldiers’ sacrifice — accusations the White House has steadfastly denied — as well as similar comments recorded by veteran journalist Bob Woodward that were made public. “Are the incumbent’s alleged negative statements about the military responsible? We can’t say for certain since we don’t have a prior trend on this question” Murray said. “But it sure can’t be helping.” Biden traveled to Tampa Florida and hammered away at Trump for those reported comments in hopes of further chipping away at that support. "Quite frankly it makes me very upset the way he gets in front of a camera and talks about how much he has done for veterans and then turns around and insults our service members and fallen heroes when the camera is off" Biden said at a veterans roundtable discussion held at a local community college. A majority of voters 53 percent also disapproved of the job Trump has done handling the Covid-19 pandemic with only 44 percent saying he has done a good job. A Florida Atlantic University poll also released Tuesday found that Biden leads by 3 points 49 percent to 46 percent among likely voters with 5 percent undecided. The results were within the survey's margin of error of 3.8 percentage points. However there were some promising signs for Trump. FAU survey respondents found that 72 percent of Trump voters were “extremely excited” to cast ballots for the president compared to 60 percent of those saying they would vote for Biden. In a statement that accompanied the poll's release the pollster said that that “undecideds are breaking for Trump 4:1.”,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/monmouth-biden-up-5-points-on-trump-in-florida-415199,www.politico.com,1600223579509

In Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti likened Trump’s handling of climate change to his management of the coronavirus pandemic saying that while climate change is not his fault “His climate denial is only making these events get worse.” Dismissive of climate change Trump has sought to capitalize instead on social unrest in California Oregon and Washington holding liberal Democratic leadership in those states out as a foil in his law-and-order-focused campaign. Earlier this month Trump threatened to curtail federal funding to “anarchist jurisdictions” or any city that “disempowers” or “defunds” its police. He specifically called out Seattle Portland Ore. New York and Washington D.C. for review. After the ambush of two sheriff’s deputies in Los Angeles he wrote on Twitter of the gunman “Animals that must be hit hard!” Trump still regularly refers to his administration’s intervention in protests in Portland including this past weekend when he called it “pathetic” that Portland’s mayor Ted Wheeler planned to move from his condo building because of protests there. “And by the way the U.S. marshals did a great job in Portland” he said to cheers. “They did a great job. You know what I mean. If Biden wins the rioters win the anarchists win arsonists flag burners they all win.” Justin Matheson a Republican consultant in his home state of Washington and neighboring Oregon said the months of protests and violence combined with the depressed economy have created opportunities for Republicans in suburban areas outside Seattle and Portland. “We’ve seen especially coming out of our [Washington] primary base turnouts of Republicans that have been better than we’ve had in recent years” said Matheson the northwest director for Axiom Strategies. “It’s not so much Trump it’s what the politicians around Seattle have done including defunding the police. Just the unlawfulness and the inability to prosecute crimes is changing the narrative in the suburbs. It’s a whole different environment than it was in January.” If Portland was beneficial for Trump’s catering to his base it was also the city that proved more poignantly than anywhere the limitations of his law-and-order appeal. His agents were met there by a “wall of moms” a nod to the suburban support that has he has shed since 2016 and failed to recover. But Jim Brulte a former California Republican Party chair and longtime legislative leader said “I don’t remember a presidential election where Portland basically had riots for 90 days before the election.” For Trump he said “I think it’s a legitimate touchstone and the fact of the matter is these are cities that are controlled by liberals and their ideology has in part led to this.” None of the disputes in the West will matter for the purposes of the presidential election on the West Coast. The last Republican to carry California in a presidential election was George H.W. Bush in 1988 and Oregon and Washington haven’t gone Republican since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Only one of four debates this fall is in the West and that is the vice presidential debate in Salt Lake City far from the coast. Harris is from California. But before Tuesday she had not been home since early spring before the coronavirus pandemic broke out. Still rarely has the West Coast drawn as much attention in a presidential campaign. “Abnormally for California we are a part of the national conversation in the presidential campaign” said Doug Herman a California-based Democratic strategist. “Normally California is mentioned to denigrate Hollywood celebrities and ‘We went to California to raise money.’” On issues of climate West Coast politicians have felt a shift in the landscape in recent weeks. Though the region has long dominated the climate debate — dispatching then-California Gov. Jerry Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee to global summits during the Trump era — the region has struggled to make an imprint in an American media ecosystem dominated by Washington and New York. “Geography still matters and the center of communications are on the East Coast not the West Coast and that has an inclination on how people including in the media view the significance of issues. It's a human trait. We certainly understand it” Inslee who made climate change a central platform of his primary run for president acknowledged in an interview. But he said the impact of the fires which have roared onto newspaper front pages across America will resonate this time and that Republicans will begin coming around to the magnitude of the challenge. “I am hopeful that when Trump goes to his reward that there will be some folks in the Republican Party who will show some leadership on this subject.” Five years ago on the eve of a Republican presidential primary debate in California Brown had all but begged the candidates including Trump to address climate change telling reporters: “My message is real clear: California’s burning. What the hell are you going to do about it?” The answer it turned out was not much. But now Brown said Monday “There’s been more print on climate change in the last month than in the last few years and that’s a byproduct of the suffering the destruction and the deaths that people are seeing in California. So this is a cause of awakening.” Brown said “The fires are graphically portraying the damage that occurs when the environment is disrupted.” Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/west-coast-battleground-trump-biden-california-414647,www.politico.com,1600223579509
EPA postpones speaker series on racism after White House order,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/epa-postpones-speaker-series-racism-white-house-415466,www.politico.com,1600223579509
That includes anything “that teaches trains or suggests the following: (1) virtually all White people contribute to racism or benefit from racism (2) critical race theory (3) white privilege (4) that the United States is an inherently racist or evil country (5) that any race or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil (6) Anti-American propaganda.” POLITICO first reported last week that the Education Department is conducting a broad review of training materials workshops and even employee book clubs pursuant to the OMB memo. It also follows EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s vow during a recent speech at the Nixon Library in California to heighten EPA’s focus on environmental justice in a second Trump term. Wheeler's call for action would include greater coordination between EPA's air land and water offices to provide communities with a more holistic approach to environmental protection. The Trump administration’s budgets have routinely called for slashing EPA’s environmental justice spending; this year's proposal sought to cut $4.8 million of EPA's $9.5 million environmental justice enforcement budget. The hourlong EPA event which was to have been held virtually on Tuesday afternoon was part of a speaker series open to all EPA staff on "Structural Racism and Environmental Justice." The series aimed to highlight "how addressing structural racism is indeed highly relevant to EPA’s mission and key to advancing the integration of EJ. The series will feature groundbreaking cutting-edge work in ways to better advance EJ by addressing structural racism." It would have featured Robert Nelson and LaDale Winling of the Mapping Inequality Project a multi-university effort that visualizes how banks in the 1930s used the practice of "redlining" to keep white and black communities segregated which has left a legacy that continues to influence the racial makeup of many communities. Charles Lee a senior EPA policy adviser for environmental justice cited the OMB memo in a postponement notice sent to EPA staff and obtained by POLITICO “Pursuant to the memorandum issued by OMB and with the expectation of more detailed guidance on implementation to be issued shortly we are postponing this event for now” he wrote. “Once EPA has received and had the chance to review this more detailed guidance we will let you know about next steps regarding the EJ and Structural Racism series.” EPA spokesperson James Hewitt said in a statement that EPA “put such training on hold” until it receives “greater clarification” from the White House. Nelson told POLITICO in an email that he and Winling look forward to rescheduling the EPA session for a later date and he rejected the White House’s argument that studying inequality is "un-American propaganda." “I think any efforts that aim to understand explore and act upon past injustices is exactly the opposite of ‘un-American’ and I think I speak for all of my collaborators when I say we're grateful that our historical work on redlining in the 1930s has been of interest and use to people doing important work like the staff of the EPA's Office of Environmental Justice” he wrote. “Understanding the sources and causes of environmental hazards and inequalities is key to the EPA's mission and is fundamental to American notions of progress and opportunity” added Winling. The speaker series' first session on Aug. 25 before OMB's memo featured Deldi Reyes the environmental justice program manager for the California Environmental Protection Agency. She discussed the Government Alliance on Race and Equity a network of state and local governments focused on racial equality. Environmental justice focuses on how communities of color low-income communities and other marginalized populations have faced greater historical and ongoing exposure to pollution. “We are adamant that people have to consciously confront the reality of structural racism and disproportionate impacts in the environmental realm” read an EPA flier promoting the Tuesday session. Biden has issued an environmental justice plan that calls for overhauling EPA's civil rights office as well as the creation of a dedicated division on the issue at the Justice Department. He also is seeking greater monitoring for communities near pollution sources and proposed targeting 40 percent of clean energy investments to be directed toward disadvantaged communities. His running mate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has also made environmental justice a top priority including signing on to two sweeping bills on the topic this summer.,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/epa-postpones-speaker-series-racism-white-house-415466,www.politico.com,1600223579509

Trump tells town hall he ‘up-played’ the coronavirus pandemic,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/trump-coronavirus-town-hall-abc-415633,www.politico.com,1600223579509
The student interjected: “Did you not admit to it yourself?” “With China I put a ban on. With Europe I put a ban on. We would have lost thousands of more people had I not put the ban on” Trump said. “We did a very very good job when we put that ban on — whether you call it talent or luck it was very important.” Back in February Trump admitted to Woodward that he wanted to minimize the threat posed by coronavirus to avoid panic even though he acknowledged to the veteran Washington Post journalist the lethal effects of the virus and easy contagion. The Post earlier this month published excerpts from recordings of more than a dozen interviews between the two. Since February Trump has publicly cast doubt on recommendations from his own health experts comparing the disease to the seasonal flu. For months he declined to wear a mask in public events and has recently restarted campaign rallies in enclosed spaces — much to health experts’ chagrin. Trump has also called for reopening vast swaths of the country contending that keeping people in lockdown was a greater risk than the virus that has claimed the lives of almost 200000 people in the U.S. The pandemic has disproportionately affected Black and Latino Americans. Trump’s pivot to his early travel ban from China and parts of Europe has become his default defense when faced with criticism of his coronavirus response. When pressed by Stephanopoulos on whether he regretted any part of his handling of the pandemic Trump said: “No. I think we did a great job.“ Another town hall participant confronted Trump on his “Make America Great Again” motto pointing out that for many African Americans who have historically faced injustices because of racism “we cannot identify with such greatness.” He confronted the president for declining to acknowledge that there is a “race problem in America” a remark that caused the president to pause. “Well I hope there’s not a race problem” Trump said. “I can tell you there’s none with me because I have great respect for all races.” Trump then repeated familiar lines on race issues saying that under his administration African Americans have had the lowest unemployments rates in history. Both the participant and Stephanopoulos pointed out that income inequality has been growing during his presidency and that many Black workers have been earning less than a living wage. But Trump refused to concede the point blaming the coronavirus pandemic for the growing inequality. “Had we not been hit by this horrible disease that came into our land and all over the world by the way” Trump said “we would be in a position where I think income inequality would be different. It was really getting there. We were really driving it down.” The president also responded to questions on police reform particularly in light of anti-racism protests that have sprung up in cities across the nation following numerous high-profile episodes of police brutality this year. Trump squarely repeated his platform of support for the police excoriating what he called “Democrat cities“ for not standing by their law enforcement agencies. Trump has often dismissed violent clashes between protesters and police in several large cities as the fault of local leadership deriding officials in Chicago New York and Portland Ore. After a string of attacks against the large cities during his town hall Stephanopoulos reminded Trump that he was president of the entire country — including its blue urban centers. “Why do you keep talking about Democrat states Democrat states?“ Stephanopoulos said. “They‘re American states American states.“ “They have things that the Republicans don't have” Trump responded. “So they are — I mean I don‘t want to say — look I‘m the president of everybody but — I don‘t want to say it but they‘re Democrat-run cities. It is what it is.“,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/trump-coronavirus-town-hall-abc-415633,www.politico.com,1600223579509

Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden steps off a plane at Tampa International Airport in Tampa Fla. Tuesday Sept. 15 2020. | AP Photo/Patrick Semansky TALLAHASSEE — Buoyed by promised ad buys new hires and Joe Biden's visit on Tuesday to Kissimmee — home to a sizable Puerto Rican population — Florida Democrats are growing more confident of the party’s chances with Hispanic voters as Election Day approaches. Florida Democrats haven’t been shy about launching attacks at their own candidate and party leadership as Biden and Donald Trump remain neck and neck in the battleground state. But that tune is changing after Kamala Harris Biden’s running mate made a stop in Miami last week and Biden chose Kissimmee for his first in-person campaign appearance.Advertisement In Kissimmee a city outside Orlando and the epicenter of the state’s Puerto Rican vote Biden planned to outline a wide-ranging plan to help Puerto Rico an island battered in recent years by natural disasters and economic instability. He wants to make it easier for Puerto Rico to get federal assistance after years of fighting with the Trump administration for help in the wake of devastating natural disasters boost payments to the island’s Medicare Advantage System and expand coronavirus services. Biden has not endorsed statehood which is among the biggest issues for Puerto Rican voters. “They have woken up and smelled the café con leche” said state Sen. Annette Taddeo a Miami Democrat and persistent critic of her party’s Hispanic outreach. “It’s absolutely not too late. I’ve been happy they are taking note.” For years the political fight for Florida’s Hispanic vote has centered on South Florida home to huge patchwork of Hispanic voters including conservative-leaning Cubans Venezuelans and Nicaraguans. That focus is starting to shift to Central Florida where more than 1 million Democratic-leaning Puerto Ricans have become a powerful voting block that has helped offset conservative Cuban voters. Florida’s complex Hispanic electorate now makes up 17 percent of all registered voters. “We are going to have a full-court press in the Central Florida region” Biden campaign adviser Christian Ulvert said. “The Puerto Rican vote is critical and the campaign is going to work hard to earn every one of their votes.” Following Biden’s appearance Tuesday big-name surrogates are expected to blanket the Orlando media market a large and critical portion of the coveted Interstate 4 corridor in the weeks leading up to Election Day. “Nothing is perfect there are always bumps in the road and we are starting to straighten them out. Is everyone happy? No” said state Sen. Victor Torres who is of Puerto Rican descent and represents an Orlando-area seat. “But we are getting there. It is getting worked out and they are trying to make it correct.” Biden’s late-hour attempt to reverse public perception of his Hispanic outreach comes amid a withering drumbeat of criticism from the Trump campaign and Florida Republicans who are casting Democrats and Biden as socialist-sympathizing extremists who support leftist Latin American strongmen. “Joe Biden is a wholly owned subsidiary of the radical left socialist agenda” said Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez a prominent Trump campaign Hispanic surrogate on a campaign call Tuesday afternoon. “Biden would strengthen Cuba’s brutal regime which would make it easier to prop up other regimes” such as Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. Biden almost certainly will win the Hispanic vote in Florida but in a state where the past two presidential elections have been decided by less than a single point margins matter. A poll earlier this month found Biden’s advantage among Hispanic voters at 53-37 much smaller than the 27-point margin Hillary Clinton claimed in 2016 when she narrowly lost Florida to Trump. Steve Schale a Democratic consultant who runs Unite the Country a pro-Biden super PAC doubts that Biden can replicate Clinton’s margins in Hispanic-heavy Miami-Dade County but Biden might not have to reach Clinton-level numbers to win the state. The Clintons had 30 years of relationship-building in Miami and Bill Clinton was one of the first Democrats to actively campaign for the Cuban vote Schale wrote in a memo outlining Florida’s 2020 landscape. “Republicans and Trump have had four years of outreach work.” Trump is unlikely to replicate his massive wins with white older and suburban voters so Biden won’t have to win the same share of the Hispanic vote as Clinton did in 2016 Schale wrote. Taddeo who as recently as last week was critical of Biden’s Hispanic outreach said the campaign has woken up just in time to a potential trap that could once again cost the party Florida’s 29 electoral votes. Biden’s visit on Tuesday builds on excitement over a $100 million ad pledge from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg a portion of which will target Hispanic voters throughout the state. Detailed plans for the commitment have been kept under wraps but the ad campaign will focus on Hispanic turnout. “The café con leche is getting whipped cream on top with the millions that Bloomberg will spend specifically on Hispanic voters” Taddeo said in an interview as she drove to do Spanish-language audio work for the Bloomberg effort. “My understanding is that it will be spent on ground and digital” said a person familiar with early planning for the nine-figure spend. “Bloomberg people are very data-driven. No one will receive money without proof of ability to perform.” Bloomberg’s money will bolster Biden’s paid media advantage in the Miami market and Spanish-language ads across the state. Biden so far has spent $11 million in the Miami market and $1.7 million on Spanish-language ads. Trump has spent $10.9 million in Miami and $800170 on Spanish-language ads according to Advertising Analytics. Still Biden needs to overcome a multiyear effort by Florida Republicans to brand Democrats as extremist socialists messaging that has been given a signal boost by the Trump campaign. State Rep. Javier Fernández of South Miami a Democrat running in a competitive Florida Senate seat said the branding effort has been under way for years. The GOP-dominated Florida Legislature for example in 2019 passed legislation to ban sanctuary cities despite the fact that no Florida municipalities have laws protecting illegal immigrants from federal law enforcement. “The consistency and message discipline have long been there. That’s what has made it effective” Fernandez said. “In Tallahassee [the Republican majority] have chosen issues to highlight extremism and rule of law. Sanctuary cities are a good example of one of those calculated wedge issues.” “Joe Biden is not a Trojan horse for the liberal left which is a growing sub-narrative” he said. “He is going to act within his own belief system.” This article tagged under:,body,https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/09/15/biden-woos-puerto-ricans-in-florida-and-gives-new-hope-to-state-democrats-1317061,www.politico.com,1600223579509
Trump’s TikTok power play may fall short,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/trump-tiktok-sale-china-414724,www.politico.com,1600223579509
One of Trump's congressional allies Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) urged the administration to “promptly reject” the proposal saying it fails to satisfy concerns about China’s influence over the app. “An ongoing ‘partnership’ that allows for anything other than the full emancipation of the TikTok software from potential Chinese Communist Party control is completely unacceptable” Hawley said. TikTok has denied that it's tied to the Chinese government and has said it would refuse any request by Beijing for its users' data. Oracle and ByteDance have disclosed no details of the deal. But they confirmed Monday that they've put forward a proposal for TikTok's future in the U.S. that must now win the Trump administration's blessing. That could be a difficult sell China watchers warned. Accepting anything short of a sale would contradict Trump's own demands for TikTok. Just Thursday he told reporters that the company had two options: "We’ll either close up TikTok in this country for security reasons or it’ll be sold.” China hawks say that choice was based on the notion that TikTok's data would be safer in the hands of a U.S. company. So any deal that doesn't resolve the underlying fear about U.S. data being funneled to Beijing shouldn't win the president's approval. "If the plan as described for Oracle doesn't meet that objective then it shouldn't go forward" said Klon Kitchen director of the Center for Technology Policy at the Heritage Foundation. "The idea of selling to a U.S. company that was just one of the solutions short of just an outright ban but the sale itself to U.S. company isn't the objective." Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that the administration received a proposal over the weekend that purports to address security concerns and among other provisions would create a global headquarters for TikTok in the U.S. and generate about new 20000 jobs. TikTok now runs its U.S. business from Los Angeles and previously pledged to create 10000 jobs in the U.S. over three years. Mnuchin said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. an interagency group that examines business deals for national security implications will review the proposal this week and plans to make a recommendation to Trump. Mnuchin said the administration's priority remains protecting the data of TikTok's U.S. users from being passed along to the Chinese government. "We’ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams” he said. The arrangement with Oracle first came to light Sunday after Microsoft announced that ByteDance had rejected its competing bid to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. Microsoft previously said it had been in talks to acquire TikTok since earlier this summer and CEO Satya Nadella spoke with Trump in early August to convince him of the sale's merits. Just days later Trump issued an executive order requiring ByteDance to cease transactions in the U.S. effective Sept. 20 because of concerns about its ties to the Chinese government. He later signed a separate executive order giving the company 90 days to sell TikTok to a U.S. company adding that the deal would need the administration's approval. As negotiations between ByteDance and potential suitors were underway the Chinese government issued regulations of its own. The Ministry of Commerce added algorithms and artificial intelligence technologies such as those that power TikTok to an export control list meaning the government must approve any sale before it can be completed. The Chinese government has since indicated via state media reports that it would not support a forced sale of TikTok to a U.S. buyer. The Chinese government hasn't said whether it consented to the Oracle deal though ByteDance has said it would "strictly comply" with Chinese regulations. The deal would have one advantage going for it in Washington: In selecting Oracle ByteDance has picked a partner that has made no qualms about cozying up to the Trump administration. Even as other Silicon Valley heavyweights kept interactions with the president to a minimum Oracle executives have become close allies of the president and helped fuel his reelection campaign. Oracle's billionaire chair Larry Ellison hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Trump in February at his Rancho Mirage Calif. home and the company's CEO Safra Catz shelled out $125000 to back the president's re-election effort in May campaign finance records show. Trump's actions come amid broader political and economic tensions with China that have dominated Trump's time in office and become crowd-rousing rhetoric on the campaign trail. He has touted a trade deal with China as a key success of his administration and blamed Beijing for the United States' failure to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic which Trump has repeatedly called the "China virus." "I took the toughest-ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of American jobs" Trump said at a Nevada rally Sunday night while adding a shot at Democratic challenger Joe Biden. "Biden's agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the U.S.A." The TikTok deal is the latest result of Trump taking aim at a Chinese technology company from the Oval Office based on accusations that its ties to the government pose a national security threat. Trump has achieved some success driving the Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE out of U.S. wireless networks and pressuring American allies not to use Chinese-made gear for next-generation 5G networks. He also issued an executive order Aug. 6 banning transactions with the messaging app WeChat which is owned by the Chinese conglomerate Tencent. "This administration has been somewhat trigger happy on the use of executive orders to target Chinese companies and I think going into November going into the election we are going to see more and more sanctions against Chinese companies" said Samm Sacks a cybersecurity policy and China digital economy fellow at New America a Washington-based think tank.,body,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/trump-tiktok-sale-china-414724,www.politico.com,1600223579509
HHS chief overrode FDA officials to ease testing rules ,headline,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/hhs-alex-azar-overrode-fda-testing-rules-415400,www.politico.com,1600223579509
“I’ve never seen such a complete political overruling of the agency” said one former HHS official. “It makes me worried about what’s to come.” HHS chief of staff Brian Harrison cast the decision as driven by legal considerations pointing to a yearslong debate over the FDA’s authority to regulate individual laboratories developing and running their own tests. “Primarily it was our lawyers advising us that this [review] requirement was illegal” he said in a statement. “Additionally everyone would agree that at the beginning of a pandemic we need to maximize the development of quality diagnostics as fast as possible.” Harrison also denied that Azar and Hahn’s disagreement led to screaming matches calling it “a lie.” “I was on this call and your anonymous source was not” he said. “Every interaction between the secretary and commissioner has been highly professional.” But Hahn and other top FDA officials see the new policy as a bewildering power grab made even more objectionable by its timing coming in the midst of a pandemic that has put a premium on accurate Covid-19 testing according to five people with knowledge of the matter. Lab-developed tests or those made and processed by individual labs including commercial giants like Quest and LabCorp have increasingly filled broad testing needs during the pandemic. But they can be “fraught” with accuracy problems spotted only in review said one senior administration official. After the FDA loosened the rules for these tests early in the pandemic — allowing labs to delay seeking emergency-use authorization — it discovered widespread flaws. Eighty-two of 125 tests eventually submitted to FDA for authorization had “design or validation problems” Shuren and FDA’s diagnostics director Tim Stenzel reported last week in The New England Journal of Medicine. Health workers perform coronavirus antibody testing at a drive-thru site in Bal Harbour Fla. | David Santiago/Miami Herald via AP The agency experienced similar problems when it decided this spring to let antibody tests hit the market without agency review. FDA reversed course in mid-April recalling scores of faulty or inaccurate tests. Officials at HHS argue that until Azar declared a public health emergency in late January the FDA did not require reviews of lab-developed tests — exercising its discretion under the old policy. “When HHS learned of the creation of this regulatory hurdle to testing we asked for legal review” Harrison said. “This deregulatory action will better prepare us for future pandemics.” The department also maintains that it did not overrule FDA “because FDA has no jurisdiction of matters of law” he added. But several current and former officials said they now suspect Azar insisted on the policy reversal despite widespread opposition within the FDA based in part on a desire to pin responsibility on the agency for the slow rollout of Covid-19 tests early in the pandemic. “This is their way of rewriting history and basically saying it’s the FDA slowing down testing” said a current senior health official. After Azar declared the public health emergency prompting the FDA to impose the review requirement for lab-developed tests HHS spent weeks focused solely on the creation and distribution of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention test that turned out to be flawed. The FDA in the meantime did not clear any labs to run their own tests until Feb. 29. The weeks between those two major decisions are often cited as the critical period during which the Trump administration squandered its best chance to contain the coronavirus. "When he put the public health emergency in place he didn't realize it was going to trigger this responsibility at FDA to go in and get an EUA" a former senior administration official said of Azar. HHS’ decision on Aug. 20 to revoke the FDA's oversight authority came with little warning or compromise. FDA regulators in charge of monitoring medical devices had no plan for communicating the shift to manufacturers or the broader public nor had they developed any contingency plans for what to do next. And in an extraordinary move top FDA officials refused to publicly announce the change themselves a senior HHS official said. Instead HHS posted the terse announcement to its own website. “It comes from a sort of libertarian ‘FDA shouldn’t interfere with the practice of medicine’ viewpoint” said one health official. “But this was such an abrupt and frankly chaotic way to go about it.” More than three weeks later the FDA has yet to endorse the new approach or offer any guidance on how it will be implemented. On weekly calls with agency stakeholders officials have not discussed any change in policy according to an individual on the calls. "Today we will not be answering any general questions about the HHS test statement of last week” Stenzel said on one of the calls according to a transcript. Pressed on the matter during a private briefing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Aug. 31 Hahn told lawmakers that HHS’ legal division was responsible for the decision a source familiar with his comments said. The FDA’s own website meanwhile still insists that it has the power to regulate all manner of lab-developed coronavirus tests. “Please note that LDTs should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA’s approval clearance or authorization during an emergency declaration for that disease” the site reads. For its part HHS has offered limited public health rationale for sidelining the FDA at a pivotal moment in the response as test production ramps up and the U.S. heads into a fall season that could bring a resurgence of both the coronavirus and the seasonal flu. Supporters of the decision contend that the more lax approach could help speed newer more innovative tests onto the market by allowing manufacturers to bypass the potentially cumbersome FDA review process. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn addresses the media during a press conference in James S. Brady Briefing Room at the White House. | Pete Marovich/Getty Images And inside the administration top HHS officials led by General Counsel Bob Charrow argued for months that the FDA lacked the legal authority required to regulate this particular slice of the testing market which includes labs located in larger academic medical centers and smaller commercial laboratories as well as a handful of large corporations. That echoes a position long held by some clinical laboratories subject to the agency's regulation. Yet it encountered fierce resistance from FDA attorneys who maintained that the agency had long established its jurisdiction over lab-developed tests during prior public health emergencies like the H1N1 pandemic and Zika outbreak. As the internal dispute mushroomed some White House lawyers also expressed skepticism of the immediate need to pare back the FDA’s oversight activities two people with knowledge of the situation said. Azar nevertheless pressed ahead a decision several officials said had soured relations with top FDA officials and career staff while accomplishing little measurable progress in the fight to contain the pandemic. Indeed the nation faced major testing access issues in February and March in part because there was no clear FDA pathway for emergency use of lab tests said former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan who has advised HHS on testing strategy. But "since then I think they have kind of got it right or at least made real progress" he said. "There's no issue with LDTs or frankly any test getting quickly through the FDA right now" a Republican close to the administration added. Going to war with its own agency in the middle of a crisis on the other hand ranks "right up there with the dumbest things ever."

People Who Stayed Home For College Share Their Best Partying Tips,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv834a/people-who-stayed-home-for-college-share-partying-tips-for-remote-learners,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Photo by shironosov via Getty ImagesHow we're adjusting our routines habits and mindsets for a new normal.If you're spending the 2020 school year in your parents’ house or just in the place where you grew up you’re definitely not alone. As of this writing 30 percent of colleges and universities will conduct courses fully or primarily online according to data tracking from The Chronicle of Higher Education. Community colleges in Massachusetts and Illinois have also reported enrollment spikes while officials from community colleges in Iowa and Virginia have told local news reporters that their schools anticipate increased enrollment on the horizon. All of these virtual and close-to-home options mean that more students than ever may have the (let’s say) opportunity to live off-campus… all the way off campus in their childhood home. Though it has its drawbacks staying in your hometown for college doesn’t mean totally giving up the traditional “college experience.” People who stay home for college still meet new people discover new passions participate in extracurricular activities and yes… they still party! Sure Mom and Dad probably aren’t down to start pregaming the Homecoming tailgates at 7:00 in the morning. But with a few friends and the right attitude you can definitely still have some solid non-sober fun. We asked people who did the hometown college thing for their best tips for cutting loose so all you homebound students can focus on picking the perfect “quirky” Zoom background to impress your professors or perfecting your at-home study set-up [link to Hannah’s piece!] instead. College towns typically suck. They are over-policed in the worst ways and the rent is always insanely high. [Partying in my hometown] was definitely safer. I don’t like not knowing where I’m at or who I’m hanging with. - Camille 23 I had a few friends from high school that stayed in town—every weekend there were the same few people pregaming at our parent's houses/a few apartments and then going downtown (where all the bars are). But I slowly met a few friends at university/from other high schools that stayed in town and we roped them into our fun. - Erin 32 Because I knew my town well I knew some spots and I had friends here already from high school so it made socializing easier. I was able to live a crazy college experience probably better than most people that move out of town all while living under my parents’ roof rent-free. - Carlos no age given Come up with your own contests and themes for parties. That way even if only 15 people show up and it's the same 15 people you've been partying with since you were 14 [years old] there's a new element to it. We used to have a cocktail contest every couple months where everybody had to create a cocktail and we'd judge them at the end. Obviously everyone would get fucking trashed. - Mikaela 22 If you parents aren't cool—like mine weren't—have a plan. Like think of one BEFORE you go out. Don't end up being the kid that drives drunk because you're afraid of your parents catching you. Walking places and being mildly inconvenienced is a lot cooler than fucking up your life! - Ben no age given Become familiar with the area and find little spots you can gather in. [In my hometown] there was a spot in the woods with a rope swing where my friends would hang out when no one could host at their place. - Suzanne 23 Always keep extra going-out clothes in your car. - Lyndsey 24 As tempting as it is try not to accept lifts from your parents. If they make a habit of it it’s hard to get independence. Try to have a trusted friend you can stay the night with if you’re too fucked up to go home. - Larry 25 The right time to talk about your adult independence and set expectations and boundaries is on a sunny Sunday morning not 3am when you just got home drunk and woke up your parents while trying to make Hot Pockets. Have those conversations before you need them in a controlled manner. - Cheri 39 Be nice to your parents. Undoubtedly you WILL need to steal their booze from time to time and being nice might make that easier. But also embrace the situation for what it is. My mom might have been pissed I woke her up at 4am coming home but she would also be the main person checking on me to make sure I was alive the next day. - Erin Be honest with your parents they are pretty cool... when you are. Introduce your friends and flings to them. It’s a good source of memories and laughter at your own expense ten years later. - Nathan 32 When possible in the time you're not in school try and do things to expand yourself as a person. Spend time outside and do some traveling if possible which can feel like a good balance to not leaving most of the other time. - Erin Fall in love with the night. Her power and ability to keep secrets is so much more beautiful than we can see. Your hometown is never as dead as you think. - Larry You can have a really fulfilling uni/college experience while staying home it just takes some more effort on your part to forge social bonds. Find your way into the scenes that intrigue you and the party invites will roll in. - Kelsey no age given As dumb as it sounds I was primed by movies and TV to have an expectation of college life that just wasn’t going to happen for me. Which is okay! I think long as you have a couple of like-minded people around you who want to have a good time too you can make it happen anywhere. - Suzanne Follow Katie Way on Twitter.,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv834a/people-who-stayed-home-for-college-share-partying-tips-for-remote-learners,www.vice.com,1600223579509
London's Trans+ Pride Is a Protest,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4ayeqw/londons-trans-pride-is-a-protest,www.vice.com,1600223579509
London’s trans community and their allies turned up in their droves for Trans+ Pride this Saturday with more than three times as many protesters attending compared to last year’s inaugural event. A 5000-strong crowd gathered for the socially distanced occasion marching from Wellington Arch through central London to protest the continued marginalisation of trans non-binary and gender nonconforming people in the UK before congregating at Parliament Square to demand answers and action from the government. While London’s mainstream Pride events might be more parties than protests these days those at Trans+ Pride had plenty to say. Top of the agenda was progressive reform of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) after the government missed its own deadline for responding to 2018’s GRA public consultation. Meanwhile the rights of transgender youth to access healthcare and surgery are increasingly under threat with Equalities Minister Liz Truss commenting in April that under-18s should be “protected from decisions… that are irreversible in the future”. With the Black Lives Matter movement gathering pace over the summer and transgender hate crimes on the rise in the UK Trans+ Pride’s organisers also demanded an end to violence against Black trans women. Speakers paid emotional tributes to their friend Elie Che a trans model and community leader who had recently moved from London to New York and was found dead in the Bronx last month at the age of 23. Organisers made sure that the event followed COVID guidelines throughout dispensing masks and hand sanitiser to the crowd but police soon threatened those on stage with a £10000 fine for organising a gathering of more than 30 people forcing it to end earlier than planned. At such a pivotal time for trans rights in the UK London’s second Trans+ Pride had a sense of urgency. A few attendees shared why they thought it was important to show up. “I’m here because transgender and non-binary people still don’t have the rights we deserve. It might seem like things are changing for the better for us but while there might be a bit more visibility and a few more gender neutral restrooms in certain places I feel like where it counts in politics things are getting worse – and I think they’ll probably continue to get worse before they get better. “We need to be protected in law and it shouldn’t be so difficult to have your gender on documents. So that’s why I’m here. I think one of the only ways to really get what we need is to show up and protest.” – Atrix “I came down today because the landscape for trans gender non-conforming and non-binary people around the world is totally unacceptable. Just this year we’ve seen the GRA plans scrapped so many Black trans people have been murdered in the US Hungary has passed a bill that means trans people can't even self-identify as their real gender anymore and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.” – Prishita “The last year has been really confusing for trans people. We've been waiting for answers from the government after the GRA consultation and we didn't get the answers that we should have got. We all put our voices out there and wanted to be listened to and I don't think we have been so that’s why we’re here to try and get them to listen to us. “I’ve got a big queer family that I want to be here to represent and I thought it was important to be here today to be together to stand up for our rights and to be with all my trans siblings.” – Paddy “I thought it was important to show up today because trans people need to be visible. We need to show that we’re a strong community and stand up for ourselves. I believe we need to be loud and vocal so our needs are taken note of as well as just being more inclusive with each other because there’s strength in numbers and the common thing we share is our trans experience. “I think a lot of people fear transness so they like to put us down or shun us so that we don’t have a voice. We need to show that we’re here we matter and we’re fabulous incredible beings. Embrace us because there’s a lot you can learn from us.” – Conn ‘They’re hurting future generations by not allowing us freedom’ From left to right: Theo and Rex “I’ve been showing up for every Black Lives Matter and Black Trans Lives protest but the reason I’m here today is that the government was supposed to reform the GRA and they haven’t – and the prospects for trans rights in the future now seem definitely worse. Recently they were talking about removing access to support for trans youth up to the age of 18 so I’m here to make sure that the younger generation don’t get fucked over.” – Rex. “It’s about protecting trans kids. If I had known I was trans from an earlier age I would have saved myself so many years of being miserable and not knowing why. Telling kids that they're wrong and that what they're feeling isn't right because they're too young to feel it is bullshit. They’re hurting future generations by not allowing them that freedom.” – Theo. “It's important to have Trans Pride not only to celebrate and show that we're here for each other and that we love each other but to stand against transphobic legislation and to send a message to the government that we’re here to fight back and we won’t take it lying down. “Things are getting significantly worse for trans people here in the UK. For a start the average waiting time to get your first appointment at the Gender Identity Clinic is something like three-and-a-half years now compared to the 18-week average for the NHS overall so even getting basic healthcare is so hard. “Meanwhile the rhetoric that JK Rowling and all of her followers are putting forward is that they're dishing out hormones left right and centre – and it's just not the case. The whole Gender Clinic system needs to be better funded and actually run by queer or trans people so that trans people get the support we need rather than being made to feel like there’s something wrong with us.” – Xoey “I think we need Trans Pride to highlight that our community needs solidarity and compassion. This year there's been a lot of active and aggressive oppression from our government. “We've had the threat of our under-18s being stopped from having access to medical help or surgeries and we've also had unfortunately the communication that we will not be able to self identify our gender [one of the aims of GRA reform]. The Tory government is hiding behind the guise that they are here for our rights that they're here to support our youth when in actual fact they’re leaving so many questions unanswered. “We were promised in 2018 that we would see reform of the GRA but Liz Truss made it very clear back in April that she wouldn’t be here for trans views. There’s a hatred of our community and it’s fuelled by fear and scapegoating. We’re seen as predators or as psychopaths when in reality we’re the most compassionate and loving community there is.” – Alexis. “I'm here to show support and solidarity to our trans siblings. There are so many things from the past that are holding trans people back and a lot needs to change. The Gender Recognition Act should have been amended years ago and I think that’s the first thing that needs to happen urgently. I think there are elements of society that are becoming more understanding but in general we really need more inclusivity. And we need more Gender Clinics. I’m from Manchester and there’s a high population of trans people there so realistically we need one set up there. I want everyone to know that we’re not just here for ourselves we’re here for the queer community because we need to win this fight.” – Jess. From left to right: Lewis and Lucia “Trans Pride is really important because we have an Equalities Minister who doesn’t care about trans people and our equality. We need a progressive reform of the GRA we need to fight for an end to violence against trans people especially Black trans women and we need to see an end to mutilation of intersex children at birth and to give non-binary people the right to legally identify themselves. “From the outside it might look like things are getting better because we have more visibility within the media but actually we’re suffering just as hard. There’s such hysteria that trans people are predators. It’s a fantasy and a fairytale and people who think that have probably never actually met a trans person.” – Lewis. @ro_hew / @heather_glazzard,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4ayeqw/londons-trans-pride-is-a-protest,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Kyoto Becomes Latest Japanese City to Recognize Same-Sex Partnerships,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azw7v/kyoto-japan-same-sex-partnership,www.vice.com,1600223579509
People wearing face masks take pictures at Odaiba area of Tokyo during the evening hour on July 12 2020.Philip FONG / AFPKyoto has started recognizing same-sex partnerships becoming the latest city in conservative Japan to give more rights to LGBTQ couples. Under the program same-sex couples may apply for a partnership certificate issued by the Kyoto Municipal Government as long as they are of legal age one or both of them are a resident of the city and are neither married nor in a partnership with other individuals The Mainichi Times reported. In a small ceremony kickstarting the new initiative on September 1 Kyoto Mayor Daisaku Kadokawa handed certificates to five couples while 20 more have applied to receive their certificates. “We will continue working hard to recognise diversity in sexuality and various forms of families” Daisaku said. The couples who took part were beaming as they posed for pictures and held the certificates in their hands. “It was our dream to become a family together. I feel like now that wish has been granted” one participant was quoted as saying. Though same-sex marriage is still illegal in Japan the “partnership system” provides a limited number of benefits given to married couples such as access to public housing hospital visitation rights and certain employment benefits according to GayTimes. Members of the LGBTQ community in Japan still face discrimination at home school and work according to Human Rights Watch. Japan was urged to pass an Equality Law before the 2020 Olympics which was pushed back to next year due to the pandemic. Last year opposition lawmakers tabled a bill that seeks to legalize same-sex marriage but the proposal was not debated after running into a roadblock set by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party which cited prohibitions in the constitution. But public opinions on marriage equality have become more favorable for the LGBTQ community over the past years with support soaring in polls. In 2018 a poll showed that almost 80 percent of people aged between 20 and 59 said they approve or somewhat approve of same-sex marriage. Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalise gay marriage last year in a historic development.,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azw7v/kyoto-japan-same-sex-partnership,www.vice.com,1600223579509

Lil’ Daddee struts onto the stage wearing a fake mustache and a boiler suit covered in grease stains. The performer picks up a large bicycle pump and carries out a suggestive routine for several minutes pulling the long rubber hose back and forth between their legs as emphatic cheers rise above the music. Lil’ Daddee is one of five drag kings battling it out in a test of “hyper-masculinity” at GenderFunk’s regular drag competition in Ho Chi Minh City. Nights like these have become a popular fixture in the Vietnamese capital’s social scene—created in 2018 it provides “safe spaces for queer artists and all humans to express their sexuality their gender and their own style of creativity” according to organizers. While most of the performers are from the LGBTQ community the event has gained mainstream appeal as its recent move to the Hard Rock Cafe in Ho Chi Minh City’s arterial Hai Ba Tung district indicates. Audience members are an eclectic mix of drag artists queer folk and couples looking for a fun night out. Vietnam’s position on LGBTQ rights defies simplistic categorizations. Compared to its Southeast Asian neighbors it is neither as progressive as Taiwan nor as punitive as Malaysia where engaging in sodomy carries a penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment. After the country’s reunification in 1975 the deeply-embedded Chinese philosophy of Confucianism with its traditional gender roles was rejected by the newly installed Communist government—which required the collective effort of all Vietnamese people to rebuild the country. The effort coincided with a clampdown on sexual freedoms with individual expressions of identity suppressed for the “collective good.” By not mentioning people who did not conform to heteronormative standards of sexuality and gender the legal system effectively ignored their existence. While same-sex weddings conducted privately were tolerated the first public gay wedding attended by more than 100 guests was held in a Ho Chi Minh City restaurant in 1997 while the first public lesbian wedding was held the following year. The outcry that ensued forced the authorities to intervene and the marriage was promptly annulled. In 2000 following confusion caused by the legal vacuum same-sex marriages were officially outlawed. However a quirk of the Vietnamese legal system allowed wedding ceremonies to continue despite the prohibition on same-sex marriage. As recently as 2002 homosexuality was described as a “social evil” by state-run media on a par with drugs prostitution and gambling. Any sexual deviation was seen as a foreign imprint the lingering toxic effects of colonial history and Western decadence. In the early 2000s the government called on organizations to "tighten state management to prevent the exploitation and the circulation of bad and poisonous information on the Internet.” Cyber cafés were regularly targeted to ensure adherence. There have been “many changes in the nation’s physiognomy” over the last two decades as Vietnam noted in its Socio-Economic Development Strategy 2011-2020 paper. As a socialist-oriented economy with aspirations to become self-sufficient in the context of an increasingly globalized world Vietnamese lawmakers see people as “the main resource and objective” whereby its development goals can be achieved. To this end the paper stipulates a need to “guarantee human rights civil rights and other conditions for people to develop comprehensively.” Relaxed internet laws have helped provide answers and a sense of belonging to queer and transgender people leading to the creation of online communities that have mobilized LGBTQ advocacy. With a commitment to human rights often made as a condition of foreign investment (take for instance this year’s newly-ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement EVFTA) several LGBTQ rights groups emerged—funded in large part by Western organizations and staffed in many cases by Vietnam’s elite youth often returning to the country after an overseas education. The first official Viet Pride celebration took place in 2012 with public events held in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and annually thereafter. The climax of LGBTQ activism came in 2014 when same-sex unions were removed from a list of forbidden relationships in an update to the country’s Marriage and Family law. This was swiftly followed in 2015 by the National Assembly voting to allow trans people the right to change their identities. In 2016 while serving on the United Nations Human Rights Council Vietnam voted to establish a mandate protecting against violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Nowhere else better demonstrates the country’s advancement towards LGBTQ rights than Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam’s largest city and the nation’s economic lifeblood. Where traditional notions of sex and gender still persist elsewhere in Saigon (as the locals still refer to it) queer and trans culture have become ubiquitous. Publicly-acceptable spaces for trans people used to be limited to performative roles such as at funerals where trans women could make a living as entertainers tasked with lifting the spirits of mourners as well as the spirits of the recently departed. Today many trans and queer folk are part of the social fabric of urban life and how people identify is no longer a matter of public concern. The apparent normalization and visibility of non-binary people in urban areas are perhaps one of Vietnam’s most underrated LGBTQ achievements. This normalization has also taken place on television screens and newspapers. In recent years programs like Come Out and Just Love have also helped to promote diversity and understanding of the LGBTQ community. Picking up a state-controlled newspaper it is not uncommon to read a story about the trans experience. Despite these advancements prejudices linger. Vietnam’s traditional family values remain deeply rooted in Confucianism which puts the needs of family and society ahead of individual desires. Multi-generational households with people conforming to prescribed gender roles and patriarchal views of man as head of the family are still common. In a country where families are considered to be the bedrock of society for LGBTQ people shunned by their parents wider social acceptance offers only some consolation. Unsurprisingly there is a generational gap with the elderly most likely to resist change. One doctor recounted the tale of a 16-year-old that was assigned female at birth though they identified as male. While the parents were understanding the grandmother was not and a man was paid to “fix” the teen—a disturbing euphemism for “corrective rape.” While the country’s recent pro-LGBTQ actions have been welcomed as a step in the right direction they fall short of providing a legal regulatory framework enabling implementation. With regards to trans people a transparent and accessible procedure for changing one’s legal gender is still outstanding and hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgeries remain unregulated. While same-sex unions are no longer banned they are also not legally recognized. A draft law protecting the legal status and rights of trans people was due to be reviewed by the National Assembly this year. But several setbacks at the Ministry of Health the department tasked with presenting the new law have stalled progress. November 2019 saw the retirement of then-Minister of Health Dr. Nguyen Thi Kim Tien. With the arrival of a Covid-19 outbreak these amendments have fallen down the national agenda. The legislative delay is further compounded by next year’s May elections. Voters will choose deputies to represent their interests at the National Assembly and People’s Councils for the 2021-2026 tenure as part of Vietnam’s one-party system. Psychological consultant and relationship expert Mia Nguyen regularly writes about gender relationships and sexual behavior in her weekly Love Marriage and Family column in the Phu Nu TPHCM (Ho Chi Minh City Women) newspaper. Nguyen who was assigned male at birth has been engaged to her Australian fiancé Austin Rennie since 2017. She longs for the day they can marry and enjoy the same rights and protections as other married couples. As it stands if something were to happen to one of them the other would have no legal claim over any property—much less over Mia’s adopted daughter. With Nguyen’s female identity not officially recognized by the state she was legally obligated to sign papers as the child’s “father” while Rennie has no official role. "Legally recognized unions open to everyone would promote family life and stability without affecting marriage" she told VICE News. In a 2014 survey of over 5000 people nearly 53% said they did not want same-sex marriage to be legalized while just 33% supported it. “The calculation is that Vietnamese society is not yet ready for same-sex marriage” Nguyen said. According to Nguyen there is an obvious alternative. “If we really want to protect all couples and families irrespective of gender and sexuality then we should at least support civil partnerships.” “Now that would be progress.",body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/935j3y/vietnam-drag-scene-lgbtq-rights-history-progress-future,www.vice.com,1600223579509

8 Times Cops Let People Go as Personal Favors (And One When They Didn’t),headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5peky/police-letting-people-go-pba-courtesy-cards-personal-favors,www.vice.com,1600223579509
On September 2 VICE published a story about PBA courtesy cards the "I know a cop" cards that can get you off the hook for traffic violations and other infractions and the police discretion they embody. We asked readers to share their experiences with PBA cards and the kind of uneven policing the cards invite. A handful of readers questioned why VICE chose to shine the proverbial flashlight on PBA cards. What’s the problem they argued with professional courtesy? More readers however reached out to share stories of uncles cousins exes and friends in law enforcement handing them PBA cards. In turn our readers ducked speeding tickets avoided open container fines took questionable shortcuts to the highway and one even dodged a very loaded public urination charge that also involved a pair of brass knuckles. After sifting through emails Signal messages and phone calls we collected nine stories that exemplify the way PBA cards stickers and other specialized police-approved forms of identification have worked and continue to work across the country and over the course of decades. These stories have been edited for length clarity and names and locations have been removed to obscure identifying information about the people involved. Are you a PBA cardholder or a cop with opinions on discretion? If you have information you would like to share you can reach the reporter directly at katie.way@vice.com or securely via Signal at +1 (571) 205-0611. It was September 2008 and I was driving back from my going-away party at one of my favorite bars. I'm pretty sure I was pulled over in Orange NJ. I was pulled over and an officer came to speak to me on the passenger's side. He asked if I had been drinking and I answered truthfully (a few beers over several hours). Honestly I was petrified. I knew I wasn't drunk but also… cops. At the time I worked at the local coffee shop. When you work at a coffee shop 6-8 shifts a week you start to know a lot of the cops in town. One of the officers in particular was very friendly with the group of us so he gave a few of us the PBA cards. My PBA card was in my wallet. I didn't pull it out but I guess it was visible in my wallet in the passenger seat. After the officer took my info he disappeared for a minute. And when he came back he asked if I had a PBA card. I was confused by what he was asking at first and then he said the OTHER officer had seen it in my wallet. I didn't realize there was a second officer scanning my car while the one on my side distracted me. He had flashed his light in my passenger side while my attention was occupied saw the card in my open wallet and I guess told his partner when they huddled up after they took my paperwork. I took the card from my wallet and he checked it over and disappeared again for another moment. When the first officer came back he handed me all of my paperwork with the card on top and said "Next time you get pulled over show that first." - Darcy The below photos are of a card I received from a friend's father a wealthy doctor from New York. He receives a number of them through his office every year because the doctors there do volunteer work with the NYPD. I've used the card 3 times since 2013—it's never been taken away from me. All instances happened on the same block in North Clinton Hill where I previously lived—mixed-race neighborhood started gentrifying in the early 2000's. First time in 2013 [we were] drinking on my friend's stoop—cops pulled up started lecturing us about it being illegal… showed them the card their tone changed and they said we should put the beer in cups or go in the backyard. Second time was in 2014 across the street from my old apartment next to a school/outdoor playground around 9 p.m. with a friend drinking a beer in folding chairs three officers pulled up. One was getting surly and pulling out [his] ticket book asked us for IDs. I remembered I had the card and gave it to him. He looked at it gave it back and told us to go drink on my stoop. Third time block party in 2016. Two young officers came saying the block party was illegal and that it needed to be broken up (it wasn't). The officers weren't speaking directly to me but I walked over with the card and said that if there were any noise complaints the block association could take care of it and we appreciated them coming out. They left but not after getting their cruiser temporarily stuck on the curb after trying to do a U-turn. Everyone laughed at them. The card never expired. I still have the card and assume it would still work. - Jacob I was leaving the parking area of a Borders Bookstore in the late 90s and at that time you could hop the curb and drive on a well-traveled dirt road that connected to another parking lot that exits to a road I would take home. As soon as I entered the drive alongside the parking lot I was "lit up" by a Hamilton Township New Jersey cop. There was no shoulder on the right so I put on my left signal and pulled into the parking lot thinking it would be safer for the cop than standing in the road. He was a hostile asshole right from the start. He was screaming at me that when a cop puts on his lights you are immediately supposed to pull to the right. I explained that my actions were intended for his safety but he was having none of it. He went on to equate my driving on a well traveled dirt road to him coming and destroying my lawn by doing "donuts" on it. He kept trying to provoke me and escalate the situation. I finally produced my PBA Family Member's Card from my cousin a police officer in New Jersey. He snatched the card out of my hand and went back to his car. After a bit he returned with a completely changed demeanor and said "You should have shown me that right from the start!" When I got home the phone rang and it was my cousin. The first thing out of his mouth was "Who in the hell was that asshole cop?" - Erick Long ago in 1971 I worked in a hamburger joint near the Hall of Justice in San Francisco. The bike cops would routinely stop by for coffee and donuts… on the house of course. My boss said it was good business to keep them stopping by... to sort of watch out for us just by being there. One night a grateful cop who had been coming in quite frequently gave me his PBA card and said to present it to an officer if I ever got into any sticky situations. It said something like San Francisco Police Motorcycle Association and then it had the guy's name. I carried it for years until one night I had too much to drink and hit a parked car. I was trying very hard to leave a note and get the heck out of there but the cops showed up before I could get it together–I was very drunk. Long story short… I gave them the card they called a tow truck for my now u car and then chauffeured me home to boot! - David A California police department used to (I don't know if they still do) issue stickers for cars that looked like a mini police shield about two inches tall that you would put on the back of your car. [The decals] are actually handed to family and friends of police officers. They didn't have the Benevolent Fraternal Order of Police shield... They actually were a department-specific police shield sticker and to prevent abuse (sic) they would change the color of the sticker every year and you had to be current to get the courtesy extended to you. Ironically enough I didn't get mine from a police officer but from a friend of mine who knew a lot of SDPD officers. They were referred to as the new “courtesy cards.” When I returned from an Iraq contract back in 2005 I relocated my family to South Florida a month later. During that month of getting ready for the move I had no car so I borrowed a buddy of mine's car who had one of those stickers on the back window. Driving in Oceanside California where we still resided at the time my buddy's car was out of date registration-wise by two years. If you're familiar with California vehicle registration stickers they change color every year so an officer can quickly identify an out of date registration. I passed a stop sign one afternoon and a cop immediately pulled up behind me and turned on his overheads. I immediately got nervous [but] as soon as the cop got close enough to see the SDPD sticker he turned off his overheads and pulled over... letting me go on my way. - Dennis Every year since I turned 17 a distant cousin [of mine] who works in New Jersey and is a member of the NJSPBA came to my house and handed out these “Gold Cards” to my brother and me. The response [from my father] felt both racist and unethical: ‘If you get pulled over you already look the part now use this and you’ve got your get-out-of-jail free card.’ Needless to say 17-year-old me kept this card in my wallet but between my levels of anxiety and genuinely mixed feelings about using it I never presented it to any of the officers who pulled me over. Of these encounters most resulted in minor tickets ($55 here $75 there) and I felt it was just—I did in fact break the law so I should pay. Last year at 23 I brought up these incidents to my cousin who ascended to a detective-level position in his precinct. His response caught me off guard as it was filled with rage and hostility towards me for not using the card… If anything I thought using it too much would’ve caused an inconvenience for him but the opposite was true. I pressed the issue and he explained that ‘giving out too many cards and not seeing them used is a problem in some officers’ minds.’ He didn’t seem to flinch at the notion of how absurd this is…. Was he hoping the card holders break the law? Shouldn’t all officers strive to achieve the opposite? I haven’t spoken to him since and I do not have the physical card anymore. It was a thick clunky piece of metal that barely fit in my wallet so when I decided to no longer carry the card I threw it away. I told this story to a few of my friends and they chided me for my decision to abandon this “ticket evader” card saying I’m helping no one by doing this. I guess that’s true… It’s not like I’m saying Hey officer I have a PBA card but I’m not gonna use it because I think this is a giant crock of shit and you should be ashamed and the officer sees the errors of his ways and fucks off. That doesn’t happen. - Max I worked at three different Starbucks locations in Suffolk County New York over the course of a decade. It was common practice to give out free drinks to police. The cops would come back and hand out PBA cards to those who took care of them. I’ve probably gotten anywhere between four and five. I’ve used them twice both times in Nassau County New York around 2018. One time the officer threw it back at me because he was angry. I was speeding apparently and he was like ‘This isn’t an excuse to speed’ or something along those lines. The other time the officer just said ‘Have a nice day.’ - Omar I’m a professional musician but there was a period in my life where I was bartending when I wasn’t playing music. I was bartending in what used to be a rougher section of the West Village between 2000 and 2004. In that job I got to know a lot of cops. One incident after a shift I was walking to the subway at five in the morning drunk out of my mind. I had about $500 on me in small bills from work I just stuffed all my ones and tens and fives into my bag. I was walking home and had to pee and I just peed on the street. A couple of officers picked me up and brought me to the precinct. I used to carry a “day bag” with me for everything I’d need to have with me after work. I would regularly carry brass knuckles I always had a switchblade knife and I would carry a cop’s flashlight the big four-D-cell battery flashlight because you could beat the everliving piss out of somebody with that. I also had drugs on me marijuana and cocaine. As the desk sergeant was going through my stuff he’s like ‘Oh so you have a switchblade? Oh so you have brass knuckles?’ And he’s taking all this contraband out and laying it on the desk. Then he was like ‘What do you have all this money for? Are you selling drugs? You have these little baggies of drugs and all these small bills…’ All the other cops were laughing like ‘Oh my fucking God this guy is going away for good.’ Every other thing that gets pulled out of the bag is some kind of misdemeanor at least. Then he pulls my ID and sees the PBA card and says ‘Oh what’s this?’ And I say ‘Oh I know so-and-so he gave me that card.’ He goes ‘So if I call this guy he’s gonna be OK with you?’ And I said yeah of course he gave me the card. So he said OK and then they took my shoelaces and put me in the holding cell for like 25 minutes. Then they came and got me and let me go. I even asked for my weapons back and they said no but they giggled when I asked for them back like I was so in their eyes non-threatening. The fact that I would ask for my weapons back was comical to them—it’s fucking bananas! - Bryan My cousin who is a corrections officer in New Jersey is given a handful of the "family member" PBA cards and would give them to me and my aunt’s stepson (who I’ve never even met) was the head of the PBA organization in his township that he was a cop in so he had the super special cards that were given out to whoever basically a “gold level” card. It had his name on it and his phone number. I would never use the gold level card because I barely even knew who the guy was. In my hometown that I grew up in Sayreville New Jersey the community was just kind of middle class Catholic school going to Knights of Columbus events and all that. There was just a PBA presence—there were PBA picnics in our town every summer. I would say I’ve been pulled over about four or five times and used it and four out of those five times I got out of it. There’s a stop sign [in Sayreville] that [the police] would just pull people over all the time for rolling through. One time I did and I pulled out [my cousin’s card] and the cop didn’t even acknowledge it. He just came back with the ticket and the court date just for rolling through the stop sign and that was that. In what is already a nerve racking experience having to talk to an officer about a cousin you don't even like just adds a whole different level of anxiety to the affair. I'm happy to not have had a card for several years. - Zach Follow Katie Way on Twitter.,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5peky/police-letting-people-go-pba-courtesy-cards-personal-favors,www.vice.com,1600223579509
People Who Stayed Home For College Share Their Best Partying Tips,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv834a/people-who-stayed-home-for-college-share-partying-tips-for-remote-learners,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Photo by shironosov via Getty ImagesHow we're adjusting our routines habits and mindsets for a new normal.If you're spending the 2020 school year in your parents’ house or just in the place where you grew up you’re definitely not alone. As of this writing 30 percent of colleges and universities will conduct courses fully or primarily online according to data tracking from The Chronicle of Higher Education. Community colleges in Massachusetts and Illinois have also reported enrollment spikes while officials from community colleges in Iowa and Virginia have told local news reporters that their schools anticipate increased enrollment on the horizon. All of these virtual and close-to-home options mean that more students than ever may have the (let’s say) opportunity to live off-campus… all the way off campus in their childhood home. Though it has its drawbacks staying in your hometown for college doesn’t mean totally giving up the traditional “college experience.” People who stay home for college still meet new people discover new passions participate in extracurricular activities and yes… they still party! Sure Mom and Dad probably aren’t down to start pregaming the Homecoming tailgates at 7:00 in the morning. But with a few friends and the right attitude you can definitely still have some solid non-sober fun. We asked people who did the hometown college thing for their best tips for cutting loose so all you homebound students can focus on picking the perfect “quirky” Zoom background to impress your professors or perfecting your at-home study set-up [link to Hannah’s piece!] instead. College towns typically suck. They are over-policed in the worst ways and the rent is always insanely high. [Partying in my hometown] was definitely safer. I don’t like not knowing where I’m at or who I’m hanging with. - Camille 23 I had a few friends from high school that stayed in town—every weekend there were the same few people pregaming at our parent's houses/a few apartments and then going downtown (where all the bars are). But I slowly met a few friends at university/from other high schools that stayed in town and we roped them into our fun. - Erin 32 Because I knew my town well I knew some spots and I had friends here already from high school so it made socializing easier. I was able to live a crazy college experience probably better than most people that move out of town all while living under my parents’ roof rent-free. - Carlos no age given Come up with your own contests and themes for parties. That way even if only 15 people show up and it's the same 15 people you've been partying with since you were 14 [years old] there's a new element to it. We used to have a cocktail contest every couple months where everybody had to create a cocktail and we'd judge them at the end. Obviously everyone would get fucking trashed. - Mikaela 22 If you parents aren't cool—like mine weren't—have a plan. Like think of one BEFORE you go out. Don't end up being the kid that drives drunk because you're afraid of your parents catching you. Walking places and being mildly inconvenienced is a lot cooler than fucking up your life! - Ben no age given Become familiar with the area and find little spots you can gather in. [In my hometown] there was a spot in the woods with a rope swing where my friends would hang out when no one could host at their place. - Suzanne 23 Always keep extra going-out clothes in your car. - Lyndsey 24 As tempting as it is try not to accept lifts from your parents. If they make a habit of it it’s hard to get independence. Try to have a trusted friend you can stay the night with if you’re too fucked up to go home. - Larry 25 The right time to talk about your adult independence and set expectations and boundaries is on a sunny Sunday morning not 3am when you just got home drunk and woke up your parents while trying to make Hot Pockets. Have those conversations before you need them in a controlled manner. - Cheri 39 Be nice to your parents. Undoubtedly you WILL need to steal their booze from time to time and being nice might make that easier. But also embrace the situation for what it is. My mom might have been pissed I woke her up at 4am coming home but she would also be the main person checking on me to make sure I was alive the next day. - Erin Be honest with your parents they are pretty cool... when you are. Introduce your friends and flings to them. It’s a good source of memories and laughter at your own expense ten years later. - Nathan 32 When possible in the time you're not in school try and do things to expand yourself as a person. Spend time outside and do some traveling if possible which can feel like a good balance to not leaving most of the other time. - Erin Fall in love with the night. Her power and ability to keep secrets is so much more beautiful than we can see. Your hometown is never as dead as you think. - Larry You can have a really fulfilling uni/college experience while staying home it just takes some more effort on your part to forge social bonds. Find your way into the scenes that intrigue you and the party invites will roll in. - Kelsey no age given As dumb as it sounds I was primed by movies and TV to have an expectation of college life that just wasn’t going to happen for me. Which is okay! I think long as you have a couple of like-minded people around you who want to have a good time too you can make it happen anywhere. - Suzanne Follow Katie Way on Twitter.,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv834a/people-who-stayed-home-for-college-share-partying-tips-for-remote-learners,www.vice.com,1600223579509
ID Laws and Stigma Are Keeping Some Trans Voters Away From the Polls,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ep4mw7/id-laws-and-stigma-are-keeping-some-trans-voters-away-from-the-polls,www.vice.com,1600223579509
100 years ago American women legally gained the right to vote. Yet today many women and non-binary people in the U.S.—and around the world—still aren't counted at the polls. The 19th in 2020 is a short series about some of the obstacles they face. When Madeleine Croll is working as an election judge somewhere around Hidalgo County in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley she makes sure to let people in her community know. Part of her oath of office as Democratic party precinct chair involved getting trained as an election judge—someone who monitors polling locations around the state solving any disputes that may come up throughout an election day like whether a certain ID is valid or not. Texas’s voter identification law one of the most expensively defended in the country went into effect in 2013 and while it includes no mention of ID gender needing to match gender presentation misguided (and sometimes malicious) poll workers are occasionally known to bloat the law’s jurisdiction. But not when Croll is working. As the first transgender Texan elected to a precinct chair position she’s able to properly interpret what the law says separate that from what some who defend it hopes it will do and make sure everyone who can vote does. Texas is one of 36 states that requires some form of ID to vote. Voter ID laws are an almost exclusively a Republican-led effort a popular way to combat the red herring of rampant voter fraud and in practice a highly effective way to disenfranchise trans and non-white voters. Several studies have found that such laws skew elections toward the right. A study from the UCLA Law School’s Williams Institute published in February 2020 found that “over 378000 voting-eligible transgender people may face barriers to voting due to voter registration requirements and voter ID laws including 81000 who could face disenfranchisement in strict photo ID states.” Trans people of color students people with low incomes and people with disabilities are “likely overrepresented” among those who may face voting barriers in the November election. Strict ID laws which require photo identification are used in eight states mostly throughout the South. (Texas’s law isn’t among them.) As of 2015 only 11 percent of trans people had documentation that matched their name and gender. According to the Williams Institute report there’s no way of predicting how poll workers in strict ID law states will interpret a trans voter’s ID or whether they’ll allow them to vote if their photo doesn’t match their appearance in person. In Harris County the mammoth Texas county in which Houston is located nearly 15 percent of nonvoters told researchers in 2017 that the reason they didn’t go to the polls was out of concern that they lacked the proper ID. Researchers also found that most people who didn’t vote for this reason ultimately did have an acceptable form of identification. One of the Texas voter ID law’s strengths in suppressing votes is the room it leaves for individual interpretation. The list of acceptable forms of identification is clear and brief; only seven are good at the polls including a passport Texas drivers’ license and handgun license. The law also mentions that in situations where a voter’s name on their ID no longer matches the name on the list of registered voters election officers are to determine whether the two are “substantially similar.” Thanks to the 19th Amendment which prohibits denial of the right to vote along gender lines nothing written in the Texas voter ID law mentions gender presentation specifically. But as Croll explained confusion and fear of stigma at the polling place effectively block trans people from voting in every election. Texas's voter ID law has changed several times over the past seven years having been struck down by federal courts and then revised by the state legislature. Because of that Croll said she believes some poll workers are simply confused when a trans voter walks into their location with an ID that doesn’t match the list of registered voters or a gender presentation that doesn’t match their ID marker. “I see the way the voter ID law in particular makes trans people nervous and impacts their ability to vote in the state all the time” said Ash Hall digital coordinator with the Texas Civil Rights Project. “When you have a law that’s intended to disenfranchise people of course it’s going to affect the transgender community because there are trans people in every kind of community.” Hall emphasized the gray space in the law which leaves far too much room for poll workers to interpret valid identification on the fly. “There’s nothing in the ID law about gender markers but so many trans people are scared that once their marker is changed on their drivers’ license they’re going to have trouble at the poll” Hall said. “And to an extent that’s actually true because even though there’s nothing in the law about that a lot of poll workers think that’s something they need to be wary of when a trans person walks in and presents that ID.” Hall said trans people in Texas are disincentivized from going through the bureaucratic rigmarole necessary to update their ID which itself introduces an entire maze of discriminatory policies. A court order is required to change gender markers on ID in the state an expensive process that usually requires the help of a lawyer. The most recent available data from Texas’s Department of State Health Services suggests that less than 1 percent of trans Texans have successfully updated their birth certificates (the context for this data was the state’s proposed “bathroom bill” which would have required Texans to use the restroom that matches the gender on their birth certificate). “Getting legal IDs is sometimes a bit of an issue for us” Croll said. “Imagine how weird it is that we live our lives as ourselves and then when you want to go practice your right as an American citizen to cast a ballot you have this person looking at you and you wonder are they going to challenge my ballot or say ‘You don’t look like this person?’” Once when Croll was working as an election judge a trans woman with a court-ordered name change that didn’t match her name on the registered voter list came to her polling location. “The clerk brought it to me and the question was ‘Can she vote?’” Croll said. “I was able to say ‘Yes no problem’ and then ‘I’m sorry you have to vote under your dead name but you can vote.’ The scary thing for me is: How many people might have that happen or won’t even go vote because they’re afraid of facing that challenge?” Croll added that she can name at least a dozen people she knows who won't vote over those exact fears. After a federal appellate court ruled the original Texas voter ID law to have a discriminatory effect in 2016 the state amended the law by adding an option for people who lack an acceptable ID to submit an affidavit explaining why (a much more arduous process than voting). But any finding of a false statement in these affidavits can be met with criminal penalties further scaring off people who are already unsure about the validity of their ID. Ultimately a person’s voting experience comes down to the poll workers at the voting location and how well-versed they are in the voter ID law and the ways in which it’s designed to leave out trans voters. “There has to be a level of education that happens especially [for poll workers] living somewhere that isn’t actively making strides to get to know the community” Hall said. “I don’t think trans people are having as many issues in Austin as they are in Brenham or even Dallas for that matter because Austin is a city that has made quite the effort to be inclusive and account for trans people.” Though even the idea that Austin is a haven for trans people in Texas is a bit of a misconception; Texas routinely has the highest rates of violence against trans people in the country and before the Supreme Court ruling in June 2020 Texas was among the states that didn’t explicitly offer protections against discrimination for the LGBTQ community. “It’s a traumatic experience to stand there and hear that poll workers are yelling across to somebody else that they can’t figure out how to proceed and outing someone to the entire line” said Emmett Schilling executive director of the Transgender Education Network of Texas about the anxieties around voting as a trans person in Texas. “I think people don’t understand how dehumanizing it is.” Something both Schilling and Hall focus on in their work around the state is educating trans voters on their rights at the polls making sure people know which forms of ID are allowed which aren’t and what can be done in the event of voter suppression over a form of ID. Schilling’s organization is also focused on educating poll workers throughout the state so voters can have a uniform experience rather than chancing their ability to vote based on their polling place. They also both bristle at the idea of moving somewhere else to a more progressive state with less discriminatory laws. “Texas can be known for being intolerant and ignorant but we have millions of people who are incredible and compassionate” Hall said. “I want to make life better for all of these folks that have to put up with a lot of intolerance and ignorance. Texas also has so much sway in terms of the way that the rest of the nation falls. So if we're able to make progress in this state it bolsters the progressive movement across the country.”,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ep4mw7/id-laws-and-stigma-are-keeping-some-trans-voters-away-from-the-polls,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Kyoto Becomes Latest Japanese City to Recognize Same-Sex Partnerships,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azw7v/kyoto-japan-same-sex-partnership,www.vice.com,1600223579509
People wearing face masks take pictures at Odaiba area of Tokyo during the evening hour on July 12 2020.Philip FONG / AFPKyoto has started recognizing same-sex partnerships becoming the latest city in conservative Japan to give more rights to LGBTQ couples. Under the program same-sex couples may apply for a partnership certificate issued by the Kyoto Municipal Government as long as they are of legal age one or both of them are a resident of the city and are neither married nor in a partnership with other individuals The Mainichi Times reported. In a small ceremony kickstarting the new initiative on September 1 Kyoto Mayor Daisaku Kadokawa handed certificates to five couples while 20 more have applied to receive their certificates. “We will continue working hard to recognise diversity in sexuality and various forms of families” Daisaku said. The couples who took part were beaming as they posed for pictures and held the certificates in their hands. “It was our dream to become a family together. I feel like now that wish has been granted” one participant was quoted as saying. Though same-sex marriage is still illegal in Japan the “partnership system” provides a limited number of benefits given to married couples such as access to public housing hospital visitation rights and certain employment benefits according to GayTimes. Members of the LGBTQ community in Japan still face discrimination at home school and work according to Human Rights Watch. Japan was urged to pass an Equality Law before the 2020 Olympics which was pushed back to next year due to the pandemic. Last year opposition lawmakers tabled a bill that seeks to legalize same-sex marriage but the proposal was not debated after running into a roadblock set by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party which cited prohibitions in the constitution. But public opinions on marriage equality have become more favorable for the LGBTQ community over the past years with support soaring in polls. In 2018 a poll showed that almost 80 percent of people aged between 20 and 59 said they approve or somewhat approve of same-sex marriage. Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalise gay marriage last year in a historic development.,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azw7v/kyoto-japan-same-sex-partnership,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Cop Who Kept Job After Killing a Black Man Now Accused of Assaulting Teen,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dza38/a-cop-who-stayed-on-duty-after-killing-a-black-man-is-now-accused-of-assaulting-a-15-year-old,www.vice.com,1600223579509

(Photo courtesy of Tierra Cox)Bearing witness to the historic reckoning with systemic racism and amplifying dialogue to drive change that delivers on the promise of racial equality. Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here. In May of 2019 30-year-old Terrance Bridges a Black man was shot and killed by Kansas City MO police officer Dylan Pifer. Pifer was never indicted by a grand jury for the killing and he was allowed to return to active duty nine days after the shooting. Just six months after Bridges died Pifer was involved in another incident according to police documents obtained by VICE News. This time Pifer was accused of aggressively handcuffing a 15-year-old Black teenager and then restraining him while his partner Sergeant Matthew Neal slammed the boy’s face into the ground breaking his teeth and requiring six stitches on his forehead. In dashcam video from that night reviewed by VICE News the teenager is heard being handcuffed and saying “I can’t breathe.” Over 1000 people have been killed by law enforcement in the United States over the last year according to a database maintained by the Washington Post and Kansas City has one of the highest rates of police killings in the country. And yet until last year no KCPD officers had ever been criminally charged with killing or using excessive force on civilians. The teenager and his mother filed a complaint against Pifer and Neal for using excessive force at the time of arrest. At first the complaint was sustained against both officers but records show that the office of the police chief intervened advising that the complaint against Pifer be dropped. No record of the incident will appear in Pifer’s personnel file. It wasn't until the family’s lawyer Tom Porto brought evidence of the incident to the attention of the county prosecutor's office that an investigation into criminal charges began. Last week Neal was charged with felony assault. There were no charges brought against Pifer. Sean McCauley the union lawyer representing Neal says that Neal will plead not guilty and “plans to mount a vigorous defense.” Neal is currently suspended pending an internal disciplinary process. Kansas City Police Department would not comment on Pifer’s involvement in the Bridges shooting or in M.R.’s alleged assault. Pifer could not be reached for comment. Terrance Bridges is just one of at least six Black men who have been killed by KCPD officers over the last three years — with little consequence. Officer Pifer was called to the scene of a domestic violence dispute just after midnight on May 26 2019. The neighbor who called 9-1-1 told the dispatcher that Bridges was armed. Officer Pifer saw Bridges pull his hands out from the pocket of his hooded sweatshirt “as if presenting a weapon” as he later said in a statement. Pifer shot Bridges once in the chest. An ambulance took Bridges to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. There was no gun. “They didn't even give him a chance. They didn't tell him to freeze or nothing” said Rotonya McGee who drove that night from Chicago to Kansas City when she heard about her son. “They gave no commands for him to do. He just took his life.” McGee described her son as a family man who loved to cook dance and crack jokes. He and his girlfriend had been planning to move back to Chicago. “Thanks to Kansas City Police Department I’ll never see my son again” she said. “They just broke my heart so bad.” Terrance Bridges now joins the list of names called out by protesters in Kansas City where following the killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville many residents are reckoning with their own city’s fraught policing tactics.

'Sorry, We’ve Already Got a Black Act' – The Insidious Racism of UK Comedy ,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dze7b/sorry-weve-already-got-a-black-act-the-insidious-racism-of-uk-comedy,www.vice.com,1600223579509
“We can’t put on a Black act two weeks in a row.” “It's just a little too urban for middle England.” “The jokes were only your typical Black stuff really.” Stand-up act Nabil Abdulrashid has heard it all during his ten years on the circuit. Talent agents promoters and club owners across the industry haven’t minced any words in telling Abdulrashid – Britain’s Got Talent 2020 semi-finalist and the youngest Black comedian to perform at the Hammersmith Apollo – he isn’t good enough. “And every Black comic I know has had the same experience to some degree or another” Abdulrashid says. “Outside of comedy these agents would not have the balls to be as brazenly racist. But nobody is looking over these guy's shoulders to make sure that they're not being racist. Nobody is doing anything!” While a renewed Black Lives Matter movement spurred equality pledges across the entertainment industry the comedy business has seemingly choked. True column inches have been filled pondering the acceptability of Blackface in noughties sketch shows but existing systemic failings in UK comedy are still overlooked. And as Abdulrashid fears this means old prejudices will enjoy an encore as live venues reopen post-coronavirus. For starters there’s the widespread attitude that every Black comedian will perform the same material. It’s a bigotry that as writer and stand-up Ava Vidal has observed sees promoters avoid booking such acts altogether. “It’s not common for comedy nights to have two Black comics booked” she says. “I mean once I was told by a promoter 'oh we've got [comedian] Joe K on next so be careful that you don't go on and say the same stuff!' He's Ghanaian and proper Christian. We have absolutely nothing in common except being Black. It’s that kind of stuff that happens everywhere in the industry.” Abdulrashid agrees: “If you're a Black guy and you talk about your experience racists all over the industry will say 'oh we've heard it all before'. But you fucking haven't! We're all different. In the US Dave Chappelle talks about being Black and so does Chris Rock. Are they the same? Imagine if there was a white middle-class comedian and it was said ‘all he talks about it being middle-class’. It doesn’t happen. So why is it okay to say 'oh he only ever talks about being Black?’” It’s a bigoted one-liner Abdulrashid says he’s received from plenty of promoters: “One time I was told by Mike Fox [the promoter behind Bromley’s FAT Jesters comedy nights] that he liked me but I made the ‘UKIP-y’ people in his audience feel uncomfortable. “He asked me to do less of the ‘Muslim stuff’ and said I reminded him of ‘Muslim activists’. I asked ‘What do you want me to stop doing? Saying I'm a Muslim? Or being a Muslim? Or having a Muslim name?’ He replied: ‘I advise comics like this all the time. Like a guy the other week did a rape joke...' He was actually comparing my identity to rape.” When contacted by VICE for comment Fox says he only offered advice on the order of Abdulrashid’s set. While clubs may be uncomfortable with acts discussing race on stage they may be more at ease with confusing two completely different dark-skinned comics. Dane Baptiste the writer and star of BBC Three comedy Sunny D was once barred from a venue after being mistaken for another Black comic. “When I proved [who I was] they were like ‘yeah but you protested your innocence aggressively’” he says. Dane Baptiste performing stand-up in Nottingham. Photo: SOPA Images Limited / Alamy Stock Photo Comedy clubs aren’t the only places Baptiste has been turned away from. After being considered by one agency he was rejected on the grounds that they “already had a Black act” on their books. “I didn't feel particularly dejected by it” Baptiste recalls. “I have been used to insecure white people since I was a seven-year-old child. I'm aware that I intimidate them.” However as Vidal knows getting signed doesn’t end the discrimination. After joining one agency she soon learned that for a Black act earning “mainstream appeal” essentially means keeping your head down: Don’t say anything too serious. Accommodate the assumption your audience is racist. She recalls one member of her former management team saying: “Let's be honest Miss-whoever-from-Sussex doesn't want to see a Black face on their TV at 6 PM on Saturday evenings.” However Vidal was never going to follow this narrative. She made politics a focal point on stage. She wrote about it off-stage. She even became a journalist for the Telegraph. And the more she spoke out the more opportunities were handed to less-experienced white talent at her agency. After several arguments – in which Vidal says she was accused of “spoiling it for herself” – she was dropped completely from the organisation. “I was constantly accused of having an attitude problem” Vidal says. “I was just left thinking ‘If you really wanted me to do mainstream sanitised comedy then why hire me?’” Ava Vidal speaking at a Refugees Welcome rally. Photo: PjrNews / Alamy Stock Photo Although currently representing herself she still knows how management can silence even the biggest Black comics. Vidal says she knows a “very successful” UK act that has received warnings from their agent after calling out racism on social media. She says the comedian in question has even asked to post “the stuff that they wanted to say” from her own accounts. With such discrimination there’s little wonder Baptiste decided the only way to break into the industry was to help form a new agency UTC Artist Management in 2013. It’s a strategy that paid off almost instantaneously: in 2014 he became the first Black act to be nominated for the Best Newcomer award at the Edinburgh Comedy Awards. This was soon followed by slots on the likes of BBC’s Live at the Apollo and Mock the Week. “If I was to subsist on their narrative I'd believe that every single White Briton outside of the M25 corridor is a xenophobic racist when nothing could be further from the truth” he explains. However there’s good reason to think Black comics will enjoy the last laugh. Although COVID-19 has devastated the comedy business – up to 78 percent of UK clubs are set to close within the year according to a Live Comedy Association report – the fallout could see many acts sidestepping the old agencies altogether. With fewer venues to play performers may have to adapt their material online an arena with limited interference from promoters. And it’s there they’re free to build up a global fan base before moving to mainstream media. Many could follow the route paved by social-media-star-turned-Channel-4-powerhouse Mo Gilligan who is now represented by Baptiste’s UTC Artist Management. “There’s a power of oppression that the industry has had for a long time. And the democratisation of the internet is definitely changing that narrative” says Baptiste. “Even though there are people in the UK who appear to be successful they cannot travel anywhere else. They have no success outside of Britain and Australia because of the amount of relatability to their material. Nobody in America really cares who Michael McIntyre is. “On a global scale if you're a cisgender heterosexual white British man you are in the minority. Whereas me I'm in the majority. And in the end it’s my narrative that more people will relate to.” Dane Baptiste’s Sunny D is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer. @thomasaling,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dze7b/sorry-weve-already-got-a-black-act-the-insidious-racism-of-uk-comedy,www.vice.com,1600223579509

This was soon followed by slots on the likes of BBC’s Live at the Apollo and Mock the Week. “If I was to subsist on their narrative I'd believe that every single White Briton outside of the M25 corridor is a xenophobic racist when nothing could be further from the truth” he explains. However there’s good reason to think Black comics will enjoy the last laugh. Although COVID-19 has devastated the comedy business – up to 78 percent of UK clubs are set to close within the year according to a Live Comedy Association report – the fallout could see many acts sidestepping the old agencies altogether. With fewer venues to play performers may have to adapt their material online an arena with limited interference from promoters. And it’s there they’re free to build up a global fan base before moving to mainstream media. Many could follow the route paved by social-media-star-turned-Channel-4-powerhouse Mo Gilligan who is now represented by Baptiste’s UTC Artist Management. “There’s a power of oppression that the industry has had for a long time. And the democratisation of the internet is definitely changing that narrative” says Baptiste. “Even though there are people in the UK who appear to be successful they cannot travel anywhere else. They have no success outside of Britain and Australia because of the amount of relatability to their material. Nobody in America really cares who Michael McIntyre is. “On a global scale if you're a cisgender heterosexual white British man you are in the minority. Whereas me I'm in the majority. And in the end it’s my narrative that more people will relate to.” Dane Baptiste’s Sunny D is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer. @thomasaling,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dze7b/sorry-weve-already-got-a-black-act-the-insidious-racism-of-uk-comedy,www.vice.com,1600223579509

Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here. In May of 2019 30-year-old Terrance Bridges a Black man was shot and killed by Kansas City MO police officer Dylan Pifer. Pifer was never indicted by a grand jury for the killing and he was allowed to return to active duty nine days after the shooting. Just six months after Bridges died Pifer was involved in another incident according to police documents obtained by VICE News. This time Pifer was accused of aggressively handcuffing a 15-year-old Black teenager and then restraining him while his partner Sergeant Matthew Neal slammed the boy’s face into the ground breaking his teeth and requiring six stitches on his forehead. In dashcam video from that night reviewed by VICE News the teenager is heard being handcuffed and saying “I can’t breathe.” Over 1000 people have been killed by law enforcement in the United States over the last year according to a database maintained by the Washington Post and Kansas City has one of the highest rates of police killings in the country. And yet until last year no KCPD officers had ever been criminally charged with killing or using excessive force on civilians. The teenager and his mother filed a complaint against Pifer and Neal for using excessive force at the time of arrest. At first the complaint was sustained against both officers but records show that the office of the police chief intervened advising that the complaint against Pifer be dropped. No record of the incident will appear in Pifer’s personnel file. It wasn't until the family’s lawyer Tom Porto brought evidence of the incident to the attention of the county prosecutor's office that an investigation into criminal charges began. Last week Neal was charged with felony assault. There were no charges brought against Pifer. Sean McCauley the union lawyer representing Neal says that Neal will plead not guilty and “plans to mount a vigorous defense.” Neal is currently suspended pending an internal disciplinary process. Kansas City Police Department would not comment on Pifer’s involvement in the Bridges shooting or in M.R.’s alleged assault. Pifer could not be reached for comment. Terrance Bridges is just one of at least six Black men who have been killed by KCPD officers over the last three years — with little consequence. Officer Pifer was called to the scene of a domestic violence dispute just after midnight on May 26 2019. The neighbor who called 9-1-1 told the dispatcher that Bridges was armed. Officer Pifer saw Bridges pull his hands out from the pocket of his hooded sweatshirt “as if presenting a weapon” as he later said in a statement. Pifer shot Bridges once in the chest. An ambulance took Bridges to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. There was no gun. “They didn't even give him a chance. They didn't tell him to freeze or nothing” said Rotonya McGee who drove that night from Chicago to Kansas City when she heard about her son. “They gave no commands for him to do. He just took his life.” McGee described her son as a family man who loved to cook dance and crack jokes. He and his girlfriend had been planning to move back to Chicago. “Thanks to Kansas City Police Department I’ll never see my son again” she said. “They just broke my heart so bad.” Terrance Bridges now joins the list of names called out by protesters in Kansas City where following the killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville many residents are reckoning with their own city’s fraught policing tactics.

Photo by Klaus Vedfelt via Getty ImagesDerek Chauvin has been charged with second-degree manslaughter and second-degree murder for the killing of George Floyd but further calls for justice for Breonna Taylor for Elijah McClain for Layleen Polonco for Tony McDade for all victims of police violence are still coming through loud and clear. In the meantime though we need to ask ourselves: When we call for justice what exactly are we calling for? “Arrest the cops who murdered Breonna Taylor!” is a rallying cry that became a gruesome meme one that’s been criticized both for cheapening Taylor’s death and for the way it plays back into the carceral system: Calling for more policing and more incarceration to deal with the problem of police violence. According to prison abolition activist Mariame Kaba using the systems that empower police to use violence to also discipline the police who misbehave only perpetuates that violence. Edward Ongweso Jr06.09.20A lot of people particularly Black women like Kaba have already put in a lot of thought as to what post-abolition justice should look like. There is already an established framework for how we can replace a system that focuses on punishment with one that focuses on rehabilitation. There are a bunch of alternatives to arrests and jail time: Community accountability restorative justice and transformative justice all offer solutions that serve survivors of harm and demand that perpetrators of harm take responsibility for their actions. They directly address the kinds of crimes that law enforcement supporters think we absolutely need police for like sexual violence child sexual abuse and murder. Here’s a little background on how these modes of justice work and intersect with plenty of additional reading. (If you already know about these alternatives and are wondering “but how do we do any of this without police?!” skip to the last section.) Community accountability relies on community members to execute justice rather than some remote disconnected authority like a department of law enforcement. According to a working document on community accountability from feminist collective INCITE! rooting justice in the community rather than outsourcing it to cops (who are statistically unlikely to live in the places they police) prioritizes survivor safety over imposing order and by doing that promotes collective action and community building. INCITE! suggests a range of strategies including a sanctuary system for survivors; social ostracization of people who commit violence; deplatforming abusers; pushing for abusers to get fired; development of an “alternative peer court system to adjudicate issues of violence;” and open honest conversations about violence with friends family and other community members. INCITE! is careful to stress that community accountability isn’t one size fits all. Instead it’s supposed to “provide ideas and to spark the development of additional strategies that may help promote community accountability on the issue of violence against women of color.” For more resources on community accountability try: INCITE!’s resource master list here This resource list from grassroots prison abolition organization Critical Resistance TransformHarm.org’s community accountability vertical here This article from peer-reviewed journal Social Justice on Philly’s Pissed and Philly Stands Up two groups organized around community justice that sprang out of Philadelphia’s punk scene in the early 2000s Restorative justice is a term those who followed the #MeToo movement closely may have heard before as a different way to address sexual violence something our criminal justice system notoriously sucks at doing. Restorative justice rebuilds the survivor’s sense of control and agency while demanding accountability from the perpetrator. This generally involves an admission of guilt and an apology often in public. This directly contrasts with how our courts work now where a perpetrator may be found guilty but isn’t actually required to admit (or even agree) they did anything wrong or demonstrate that they understand how and why what they did was wrong. As restorative justice facilitator sujatha baliga wrote for Vox people who have been harmed “want to hear the person who assaulted them say ‘You’re telling the truth. I did that to you. It’s my fault not yours.’ They often want this admission to happen in the presence of both of their families and friends. Most survivors are also looking for some indication that the person who harmed them truly understands what they’ve done and that they won’t do it again.” To address sexual assault burglarly and even murder baliga says we could use conference circles; confessions in the presence of family members and other loved ones; and facilitated discussions between survivors and perpetrators.

According to TransformHarm.org transformative justice breaks down into three parts: supporting a survivor’s healing process often via confrontation with the person who harmed them; community accountability where community members confront their own complicity and build their capacity to support these interventions; and community education and skill-building to prevent future harm. “[Transformative justice] is not only identifying what we don’t want but proactively practicing and putting in place things we want” according to the website. This includes “healthy relationships good communication skills skills to de-escalate active or ‘live’ harm and violence in the moment learning how to express our anger in ways that are not destructive incorporating healing into our everyday lives.” For more reading on transformative justice: Check out the transformative justice curriculum for community organizers that Kaba’s Project NIA an advocacy organization seeking to abolish policing and end mass incarceration There’s also a handbook from Generation Five that outlines transformative justice specifically as it applies to ending child sexual abuse For a full-length overview of transformative justice pick up Beyond Survival a collection of essays interviews and tools from activists in the field There’s no one answer to this question but that doesn’t mean it’s a gotcha moment because there are actually a lot of possible answers. We might imagine that people who commit crimes will have no interest in admitting guilt or participating in any of the above without the force of police arrests and investigations but there are indications that that largely isn’t true. The Vox piece above has an instructive example of restorative justice in a sexual assault with no witnesses. We’ve seen many such cases over the last few years play out in similar ways: In our legal system the perpetrator might be found not guilty or be awaiting trial but the general public ostracizes them; that is we already have some sense that arrest and the threat of prison aren’t sufficient solutions. In the Vox piece’s example the assaulter is given the opportunity to apologize and submit to conversations about reforming his behavior which not only helps heal his victim but allows him learn to be a part of the solution—baliga mentions the assaulter sending her a draft of at research paper he wrote on sexual violence. Because there aren’t any similar systems formally in place yet it’s hard to know if that result is typical. But social workers medics and trained facilitators could all pick up a lot of the work normally shunted to minimally trained unspecialized cops —in fact they already have though on a smaller scale than the one abolitionists are currently calling for. According to a report from VICE News programs across the country have already experimented with taking control of mental health crises homelessness traffic issues drugs and sex work out of the hands of the police and replacing them with more qualified actors. “The difficulty in policing is that we use a one-size-fits-all model” Barry Friedman who runs New York University’s Policing Project told VICE News. “Police just aren’t trained to do a lot of the things they end up doing. They are trained for force and law. So you get force-and-law results.” These new methods of justice very much map onto how we should be dealing with cops whose actions or words have harmed the people they police. Applied to the police officers responsible for civilian deaths a community accountability solution could include naming and shaming them (check!) termination from the police force along with the guarantee that they will be barred from working in law enforcement or security positions for the rest of their lives (or until those positions stop existing). A restorative justice solution could involve police officers sitting down with family members of those they’ve injured or killed to acknowledge the immense damage they’ve done. A transformative justice solution to police violence? That’s police abolition baby! If all of the above sounds like a lot of hard work that’s because it is. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible. “Defund disarm abolish the police!” is easy to chant harder to envision and essential to actualize according to the activists who’ve been working towards a cop-free future for decades. Using these modes of justice and accountability though a better future is only as limited as our own collective imagination.

8 Times Cops Let People Go as Personal Favors (And One When They Didn’t),headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5peky/police-letting-people-go-pba-courtesy-cards-personal-favors,www.vice.com,1600223579509
On September 2 VICE published a story about PBA courtesy cards the "I know a cop" cards that can get you off the hook for traffic violations and other infractions and the police discretion they embody. We asked readers to share their experiences with PBA cards and the kind of uneven policing the cards invite. A handful of readers questioned why VICE chose to shine the proverbial flashlight on PBA cards. What’s the problem they argued with professional courtesy? More readers however reached out to share stories of uncles cousins exes and friends in law enforcement handing them PBA cards. In turn our readers ducked speeding tickets avoided open container fines took questionable shortcuts to the highway and one even dodged a very loaded public urination charge that also involved a pair of brass knuckles. After sifting through emails Signal messages and phone calls we collected nine stories that exemplify the way PBA cards stickers and other specialized police-approved forms of identification have worked and continue to work across the country and over the course of decades. These stories have been edited for length clarity and names and locations have been removed to obscure identifying information about the people involved. Are you a PBA cardholder or a cop with opinions on discretion? If you have information you would like to share you can reach the reporter directly at katie.way@vice.com or securely via Signal at +1 (571) 205-0611. It was September 2008 and I was driving back from my going-away party at one of my favorite bars. I'm pretty sure I was pulled over in Orange NJ. I was pulled over and an officer came to speak to me on the passenger's side. He asked if I had been drinking and I answered truthfully (a few beers over several hours). Honestly I was petrified. I knew I wasn't drunk but also… cops. At the time I worked at the local coffee shop. When you work at a coffee shop 6-8 shifts a week you start to know a lot of the cops in town. One of the officers in particular was very friendly with the group of us so he gave a few of us the PBA cards. My PBA card was in my wallet. I didn't pull it out but I guess it was visible in my wallet in the passenger seat. After the officer took my info he disappeared for a minute. And when he came back he asked if I had a PBA card. I was confused by what he was asking at first and then he said the OTHER officer had seen it in my wallet. I didn't realize there was a second officer scanning my car while the one on my side distracted me. He had flashed his light in my passenger side while my attention was occupied saw the card in my open wallet and I guess told his partner when they huddled up after they took my paperwork. I took the card from my wallet and he checked it over and disappeared again for another moment. When the first officer came back he handed me all of my paperwork with the card on top and said "Next time you get pulled over show that first." - Darcy The below photos are of a card I received from a friend's father a wealthy doctor from New York. He receives a number of them through his office every year because the doctors there do volunteer work with the NYPD. I've used the card 3 times since 2013—it's never been taken away from me. All instances happened on the same block in North Clinton Hill where I previously lived—mixed-race neighborhood started gentrifying in the early 2000's. First time in 2013 [we were] drinking on my friend's stoop—cops pulled up started lecturing us about it being illegal… showed them the card their tone changed and they said we should put the beer in cups or go in the backyard. Second time was in 2014 across the street from my old apartment next to a school/outdoor playground around 9 p.m. with a friend drinking a beer in folding chairs three officers pulled up. One was getting surly and pulling out [his] ticket book asked us for IDs. I remembered I had the card and gave it to him. He looked at it gave it back and told us to go drink on my stoop. Third time block party in 2016. Two young officers came saying the block party was illegal and that it needed to be broken up (it wasn't). The officers weren't speaking directly to me but I walked over with the card and said that if there were any noise complaints the block association could take care of it and we appreciated them coming out. They left but not after getting their cruiser temporarily stuck on the curb after trying to do a U-turn. Everyone laughed at them. The card never expired. I still have the card and assume it would still work. - Jacob I was leaving the parking area of a Borders Bookstore in the late 90s and at that time you could hop the curb and drive on a well-traveled dirt road that connected to another parking lot that exits to a road I would take home. As soon as I entered the drive alongside the parking lot I was "lit up" by a Hamilton Township New Jersey cop. There was no shoulder on the right so I put on my left signal and pulled into the parking lot thinking it would be safer for the cop than standing in the road. He was a hostile asshole right from the start. He was screaming at me that when a cop puts on his lights you are immediately supposed to pull to the right. I explained that my actions were intended for his safety but he was having none of it. He went on to equate my driving on a well traveled dirt road to him coming and destroying my lawn by doing "donuts" on it. He kept trying to provoke me and escalate the situation. I finally produced my PBA Family Member's Card from my cousin a police officer in New Jersey. He snatched the card out of my hand and went back to his car. After a bit he returned with a completely changed demeanor and said "You should have shown me that right from the start!" When I got home the phone rang and it was my cousin. The first thing out of his mouth was "Who in the hell was that asshole cop?" - Erick Long ago in 1971 I worked in a hamburger joint near the Hall of Justice in San Francisco. The bike cops would routinely stop by for coffee and donuts… on the house of course. My boss said it was good business to keep them stopping by... to sort of watch out for us just by being there. One night a grateful cop who had been coming in quite frequently gave me his PBA card and said to present it to an officer if I ever got into any sticky situations. It said something like San Francisco Police Motorcycle Association and then it had the guy's name. I carried it for years until one night I had too much to drink and hit a parked car. I was trying very hard to leave a note and get the heck out of there but the cops showed up before I could get it together–I was very drunk. Long story short… I gave them the card they called a tow truck for my now u car and then chauffeured me home to boot! - David A California police department used to (I don't know if they still do) issue stickers for cars that looked like a mini police shield about two inches tall that you would put on the back of your car. [The decals] are actually handed to family and friends of police officers. They didn't have the Benevolent Fraternal Order of Police shield... They actually were a department-specific police shield sticker and to prevent abuse (sic) they would change the color of the sticker every year and you had to be current to get the courtesy extended to you. Ironically enough I didn't get mine from a police officer but from a friend of mine who knew a lot of SDPD officers. They were referred to as the new “courtesy cards.” When I returned from an Iraq contract back in 2005 I relocated my family to South Florida a month later. During that month of getting ready for the move I had no car so I borrowed a buddy of mine's car who had one of those stickers on the back window. Driving in Oceanside California where we still resided at the time my buddy's car was out of date registration-wise by two years. If you're familiar with California vehicle registration stickers they change color every year so an officer can quickly identify an out of date registration. I passed a stop sign one afternoon and a cop immediately pulled up behind me and turned on his overheads. I immediately got nervous [but] as soon as the cop got close enough to see the SDPD sticker he turned off his overheads and pulled over... letting me go on my way. - Dennis Every year since I turned 17 a distant cousin [of mine] who works in New Jersey and is a member of the NJSPBA came to my house and handed out these “Gold Cards” to my brother and me. The response [from my father] felt both racist and unethical: ‘If you get pulled over you already look the part now use this and you’ve got your get-out-of-jail free card.’ Needless to say 17-year-old me kept this card in my wallet but between my levels of anxiety and genuinely mixed feelings about using it I never presented it to any of the officers who pulled me over. Of these encounters most resulted in minor tickets ($55 here $75 there) and I felt it was just—I did in fact break the law so I should pay. Last year at 23 I brought up these incidents to my cousin who ascended to a detective-level position in his precinct. His response caught me off guard as it was filled with rage and hostility towards me for not using the card… If anything I thought using it too much would’ve caused an inconvenience for him but the opposite was true. I pressed the issue and he explained that ‘giving out too many cards and not seeing them used is a problem in some officers’ minds.’ He didn’t seem to flinch at the notion of how absurd this is…. Was he hoping the card holders break the law? Shouldn’t all officers strive to achieve the opposite? I haven’t spoken to him since and I do not have the physical card anymore. It was a thick clunky piece of metal that barely fit in my wallet so when I decided to no longer carry the card I threw it away. I told this story to a few of my friends and they chided me for my decision to abandon this “ticket evader” card saying I’m helping no one by doing this. I guess that’s true… It’s not like I’m saying Hey officer I have a PBA card but I’m not gonna use it because I think this is a giant crock of shit and you should be ashamed and the officer sees the errors of his ways and fucks off. That doesn’t happen. - Max I worked at three different Starbucks locations in Suffolk County New York over the course of a decade. It was common practice to give out free drinks to police. The cops would come back and hand out PBA cards to those who took care of them. I’ve probably gotten anywhere between four and five. I’ve used them twice both times in Nassau County New York around 2018. One time the officer threw it back at me because he was angry. I was speeding apparently and he was like ‘This isn’t an excuse to speed’ or something along those lines. The other time the officer just said ‘Have a nice day.’ - Omar I’m a professional musician but there was a period in my life where I was bartending when I wasn’t playing music. I was bartending in what used to be a rougher section of the West Village between 2000 and 2004. In that job I got to know a lot of cops. One incident after a shift I was walking to the subway at five in the morning drunk out of my mind. I had about $500 on me in small bills from work I just stuffed all my ones and tens and fives into my bag. I was walking home and had to pee and I just peed on the street. A couple of officers picked me up and brought me to the precinct. I used to carry a “day bag” with me for everything I’d need to have with me after work. I would regularly carry brass knuckles I always had a switchblade knife and I would carry a cop’s flashlight the big four-D-cell battery flashlight because you could beat the everliving piss out of somebody with that. I also had drugs on me marijuana and cocaine. As the desk sergeant was going through my stuff he’s like ‘Oh so you have a switchblade? Oh so you have brass knuckles?’ And he’s taking all this contraband out and laying it on the desk. Then he was like ‘What do you have all this money for? Are you selling drugs? You have these little baggies of drugs and all these small bills…’ All the other cops were laughing like ‘Oh my fucking God this guy is going away for good.’ Every other thing that gets pulled out of the bag is some kind of misdemeanor at least. Then he pulls my ID and sees the PBA card and says ‘Oh what’s this?’ And I say ‘Oh I know so-and-so he gave me that card.’ He goes ‘So if I call this guy he’s gonna be OK with you?’ And I said yeah of course he gave me the card. So he said OK and then they took my shoelaces and put me in the holding cell for like 25 minutes. Then they came and got me and let me go. I even asked for my weapons back and they said no but they giggled when I asked for them back like I was so in their eyes non-threatening. The fact that I would ask for my weapons back was comical to them—it’s fucking bananas! - Bryan My cousin who is a corrections officer in New Jersey is given a handful of the "family member" PBA cards and would give them to me and my aunt’s stepson (who I’ve never even met) was the head of the PBA organization in his township that he was a cop in so he had the super special cards that were given out to whoever basically a “gold level” card. It had his name on it and his phone number. I would never use the gold level card because I barely even knew who the guy was. In my hometown that I grew up in Sayreville New Jersey the community was just kind of middle class Catholic school going to Knights of Columbus events and all that. There was just a PBA presence—there were PBA picnics in our town every summer. I would say I’ve been pulled over about four or five times and used it and four out of those five times I got out of it. There’s a stop sign [in Sayreville] that [the police] would just pull people over all the time for rolling through. One time I did and I pulled out [my cousin’s card] and the cop didn’t even acknowledge it. He just came back with the ticket and the court date just for rolling through the stop sign and that was that. In what is already a nerve racking experience having to talk to an officer about a cousin you don't even like just adds a whole different level of anxiety to the affair. I'm happy to not have had a card for several years. - Zach Follow Katie Way on Twitter.,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5peky/police-letting-people-go-pba-courtesy-cards-personal-favors,www.vice.com,1600223579509
A 17-Year-Old Aspiring Cop Has Been Charged With Murder In Kenosha,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xg8pxj/a-17-year-old-aspiring-cop-has-been-charged-with-murder-in-kenosha,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Warning: Graphic descriptions and video. A 17-year-old aspiring cop has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder for his alleged role in a shooting during a protest in Kenosha Wisconsin on Tuesday night that left two dead and one injured. The suspect was identified as Kyle Rittenhouse of Lake County Illinois. Prosecutors in Lake County filed the charges at noon Wednesday and labelled him a fugitive who “fled the state of Wisconsin with intent to avoid prosecution for that offense.” Tuesday was the third consecutive night of angry protests in Kenosha since police shot Jacob Blake a Black man leaving him paralyzed. Rittenhouse clad in a green t-shirt a cap emblazoned with an American flag and carrying an assault rifle was seen on video at various points of the night. In several graphic videos he’s seen opening fire on protesters; one was shot in the head another in the chest. The victim who survived was shot in the arm. While it’s not immediately clear why Rittenhouse a former police cadet was at the protest his social media indicates an affiliation with “Back the Blue” a pro-police movement. In recent months pro-cop vigilantes have been showing up heavily armed at protests across the country to defend public property often warmly received by local law enforcement. Police interacted with the alleged gunman at various locations in Kenosha throughout the night. In one video Rittenhouse is seen chatting with police who gave him a bottle of water and thanked him for being there. He was also seen in the vicinity of a group of armed militiamen who had tasked themselves with protecting a gas station from damage. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth acknowledged their presence in an interview with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel but said he wasn’t sure if the suspected shooter was affiliated with them. The shooting started around 11.30 p.m. hours after the curfew when a heated confrontation broke out between protesters and the militia men near the gas station. Around that same time gunshots rang out by an auto-body shop a few blocks away. Video shows a group of people running down the street including the man in the green t-shirt who appears to be being chased. He and his pursuer briefly disappear behind parked cars and then gunshots are heard. “He’s got a gun he shot him” the person recording the video is heard saying. Other videos from the scene suggest that there may have been additional gunfire from another direction. Video shows protesters surrounding the victim who is lying on the ground between two cars. Multiple people are using their phones as flashlights trying to figure out where he’s been shot. “In his head in his head — put pressure on it — put pressure come on” one woman says while holding his head near a bullet wound and telling him “keep your eyes open.” Video from another angle shows the man in the green t-shirt standing there on the phone. “I’ve just killed somebody” he says into his phone as he starts to move away. Soon after another video shows a crowd chasing the suspect down the street. “What did he do?” someone asks. “He shot someone!” someone else replies. The man appears to trip and fall. Two protesters run towards him he sits up and shoots them both. One person lies motionless in the street. “Medic!” someone in the crowd cries out. That victim survived and was seen later being treated for a bullet wound in his arm. The apparent shooter meanwhile was seen on video walking away from the scene — his AR-style rifle clearly visible his hands above his head. But Kenosha police who were responding to the reports of gunfire showed no interest in arresting or even questioning the man. Instead they asked him for directions. “Is someone injured straight ahead?” an officer asks him via loudspeaker. “Get out of the road” said another. He even approached an idling police car going up close to the window but then appeared to change his mind and walked away. Brent Ford 24 a photographer witnessed the entire scene. “He had his hands up and they told him to get out of there even though everyone was yelling that he was the shooter” Ford told VICE News. “The police didn’t seem to hear or care what the crowd was saying.” Ford said many in the crowd were armed — not just the militiamen who were standing guard outside a nearby gas station. For example members of the Socialist Rifle Association an armed leftist gun group were present. Other protesters had pistols in holsters. “I had kinda gotten the feeling the police were overwhelmed and didn’t really know what they were doing most of the night” said Ford. Ford had also observed that the militiamen seen earlier appeared to be getting special treatment from the police. “One of the police in the Bearcat was yelling over the LRAD [a speaker system] for everyone press and protesters to disperse” said Ford. “I noticed that group of armed I guess militia or citizens at the gas station behind the police lines weren’t getting told to leave the area and it kind of struck me as weird.” The shooter has meanwhile been hailed as a “hero” by the far-right. “That boy is a patriot” one person wrote on the imageboard 4chan. “Well he became a man today that’s for sure” another commented.

The Little Cards That Tell Police 'Let's Forget This Ever Happened',headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7gxa4/pba-card-police-courtesy-cards,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Bearing witness to the historic reckoning with systemic racism and amplifying dialogue to drive change that delivers on the promise of racial equality. Mike a white man in his 50s was in a bad spot: He was stuck idling in traffic on New York City’s Riverside Drive running late for a meeting and he needed to get to the Upper East Side pronto. Hopping on the shoulder to bypass the other cars wasn’t the right thing to do he told VICE but he’d seen other people get away with it before. Mike whose name has been changed to protect his privacy said he knew it was risky—especially because the borrowed car he was driving didn’t have a license plate let alone a registration under his name. He decided to roll the dice anyway. Right away bad news: a traffic checkpoint and cops pulling people over. “That was probably the tightest spot I could've been in” Mike said. “Because [the offense] could've been ‘driving without a plate’ ‘driving with no registration...’" By driving on the shoulder too Mike was driving illegally in at least three different ways. Despite that he felt confident as the cop approached his car and told him to roll down his window. Instead of pulling out his driver’s license Mike simply introduced himself and produced something better. “I just basically happened to have one of their PBA cards on me” he said referring to the small plastic "courtesy" cards issued by the Police Benevolent Association which usually have an officer’s name phone number and signature on the back. The cards are designed to be presented in a low-stakes police encounter like a traffic stop as a laminated wink-and-nudge between officers that says “Hey would you mind going a little easy on this one?” When a cop is handed a PBA card they can call the number on it to verify the relationship between the cardholder and the issuer then decide whether it means they should give the cardholder a break. According to Mike the officer looked at the card then let him go without asking for ID or the car’s registration. "By knowing somebody and having that connection it worked” Mike said. The somebody Mike knew was a U.S. Route 1 patrolman a colleague of the cops who’d pulled him over. Though he didn’t have a license plate or registration he did have proof of that “connection” and it was all he needed to be on his way without any trouble. As he did on that day in 1993 Mike has continued to carry use and benefit from PBA cards for almost three decades. Are you a PBA cardholder or a cop with opinions on discretion? If you have information you would like to share you can reach the reporter directly at katie.way@vice.com or securely via Signal at +1 (571) 205-0611. Though Mike’s story may seem like it comes from a less-scrutinized outdated era of law enforcement PBA cards are still used and accepted in the present without much oversight. They serve as a physical example of how cops are able to exercise the law largely as they feel personally is right. With a few exceptions PBA cards aren’t a normal part of life for most people in the U.S. Though they do confer some privilege and exclusivity the cards aren't exactly a secret. The Police Benevolent Association New York City’s largest police union issues these courtesy cards—nicknamed "get out of jail free cards"—to its members on a yearly basis. Members can pass the cards out to whomever they choose to provide them with a little extra protection. Mike works in an industry that regularly puts him into contact with police officers which gives him the opportunity to form personal trusting relationships with them. As such he said he frequently receives PBA cards as a thank-you for extending cops small business favors and deals; currently he estimates that he has somewhere between 10 and 12 unexpired courtesy cards in his possession. They're ideal for slipping into a wallet alongside other forms of identification. (Driver’s license? Check. Work ID? Check. “I’m friends with a cop” card? Check.) Other New York City police unions like the Detectives’ Endowment Association and the Sergeants Benevolent Association do the same with their own courtesy cards; elsewhere police unions in Philadelphia Los Angeles and Boston have a history of issuing courtesy cards of their own. (The Detectives’ Endowment Association and Sergeants Benevolent Association did not respond to requests for comment. The NYC PBA declined to comment for this story.) According to John Driscoll an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice PBA cards aren’t quite carte blanche to flout the law. Driscoll a former NYPD officer himself told VICE that in his experience the cards are most likely to work in one’s favor during traffic stops for minor infractions like speeding or a busted tail light—and not in more serious cases like drunk driving. When a PBA card is presented it's up to the officer how they want to factor it into a stop. “Some officers I think they'd summons their own mother” Driscoll said. “The card doesn't mean anything to them. Other people [are less that way]; we have wide discretion when it comes to issuing summonses so officers exercise that all the time” he said in order to let PBA cardholders off the hook for minor infractions if they so choose. It may seem inconsequential when that choice means a police officer’s 19-year-old nephew walks away with a warning for running a stop sign in his suburban neighborhood. But because cops can also use discretion to over-apply the law violently to vulnerable populations PBA cards and the privileges they confer are darkly emblematic of how certain people are favored in situations in which others are endangered or hurt by police. The existence of these cards is a concrete example of a larger often more insidious problem in American policing: Discretionary decision-making allows police to pick and choose who the law really applies to—and who gets a pass. “Usually when we think about discretion we think about what cops can do. But on the street it's also who they won't harass who they won't arrest who they choose to let off.” There are countless cases many well-documented of police brutality that have begun with a cop pulling a Black or nonwhite driver over for the type of very routine traffic stop that PBA cards are designed to smooth over. The “broken taillight” infraction has become a trope when it comes to police violence specifically against Black people: In 2016 a Minneapolis police officer killed Philando Castile after pulling him over for a broken taillight; Castile was reportedly pulled over for similar infractions on a regular basis. (The officer in question was later acquitted.) Black Americans have filed lawsuits against police officers in Aurora Colorado and Shreveport Louisiana alleging discriminatory and violent treatment during broken taillight stops fortunately without deadly consequences. In 2015 Sandra Bland was pulled over in Prairie View Texas for failing to signal while changing lanes; after a state trooper threatened her with a stun gun Bland was taken into custody where she was found dead three days later. There are many other accounts of police choosing violence against the people they pull over for minor traffic infractions particularly if they aren't white. To illustrate how discretion permeates issues of policing large and small David Correia an associate professor at the University of New Mexico and co-author of Police: A Field Guide also pointed to over-policing in the “crime-infested” neighborhoods overwhelmingly populated by Black and brown people living at or below the poverty line; and the proven inability of so-called “chokehold bans” to curb the police use of chokeholds. While injustices like these have gradually begun to receive the attention they need the way that cops apply discretion in the other direction—in the form of favoritism toward people who are friendly to police—is a matter that they and their PBA-card-holding associates work to keep quiet especially as it contrasts starkly with the gross mistreatment that people of color receive. “Usually when we think about discretion we think about what cops can do what law permits them to do what law constrains them from doing” Correia said. “But on the street it's also who they won't harass who they won't arrest who they choose to let off.” In separate interviews with VICE Correia and Tyler Wall the other co-author of Police: A Field Guide both emphasized the fact that these cards typify the concept of police discretion. “It does show a certain level of built-in ingrained logic of the police” Wall said: “There are people who should be able to perform their love for the cop in order to get out of a ticket.” In practice Correia and Wall said those who are able to “get off easy” from an encounter with the police typically look and act a lot like Mike an affable white person who respects police authority and is careful to address them with friendly deference—to act the part of the sheepish apologetic innocent who understands that the cop is “just doing their job.” (And given the publicly available data on the demographics of the NYPD and New Jersey state police the majority of police issuing cards are likely white officers.) “The best way to use a PBA card is to not have to use it” Jack a white man in his 30s told VICE. Like Mike Jack works in an industry that brings him in frequent close contact with police officers who occasionally give him PBA cards for a job well done. But Jack also counts cops among his friends and family and he said those relationships have instilled him with an extra sense of responsibility as a PBA card carrier. Jack last used a PBA card in 2019 when he was pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike in the early hours of the morning. “I was speeding” Jack said. “I was doing close to 90 miles an hour. I was probably a good 15 to 20 miles over the speed limit.” When Jack was pulled over—on his way to work with his father a co-worker in the passenger seat—he felt a thrill of nervousness as the cop approached his window. Jack said he’s only used a PBA card three times total and has never felt truly comfortable doing so because he feels cautious almost reverent about the statement he’s making when he displays one. “Whenever I hand that card over to the police officer I’m showing the type of person I am and it’s reflecting off whoever gave me that card” he said. The exchange was brief and friendly. The traffic cop knew the cop whose PBA card Jack handed over so after a quick phone call to confirm Jack obtained the card legitimately the traffic cop let Jack go after issuing him a written warning. “He was still doing his job” Jack said. “But he did let me off from getting a ticket. I have a feeling he gave me the warning because I had the card.” Jack said he didn’t think it would be right to use a PBA card to extract himself from a more serious situation like a bar fight or reckless driving—he wouldn’t want the cop who gave him a PBA card to be implicated in his bad behavior and he also wouldn’t want to pressure a cop attempting to ticket him into bending the rules just because he had a privileged relationship with another law enforcement officer. But at the same time Jack knows what he’s signaling when he shows a cop his PBA card. “In my opinion it’s basically something you hand over to the police officer to show that hey I'm close with this cop. He gave it to me. He wouldn't have given it to me if he didn't trust me” Jack said. “Here it is you know you do what you do with it.” Officer discretion is at the core of modern policing—it vests cops with the power to choose if when how to whom and to what extent they will apply the law. The school resource officers who handcuff disabled children for acting out in class are free to do so because they’ve determined using discretion that it is necessary. The cop who returned a scared naked teenager to Jeffrey Dahmer after the 14-year-old boy escaped the murderer’s house? Also exercising discretion. Literature on discretion that’s favorable to the police effectively states that this decision-making power can’t be limited because to do so would curb their ability to react in the moment and enforce the law. According to the preface of criminologist George L. Kelling’s 1999 report for the Department of Justice on discretion and police training (guided by the still-influential “broken windows” police theory he helped ideate): “We now understand that telling officers only what they cannot do which is so typical of police manuals and rules and regulations has not improved the quality of policing. We know as well that the work world of police is too complex to tell officers exactly what they should do in every circumstance.” Kelling goes on to advocate for training that teaches cops about how to think rather than how to act in the field—how to identify disorder and criminal potential without placing firm limits on how to act once a supposed threat is identified. This mindset has unsurprisingly been linked to racial profiling and the criminalization of unhoused populations something Kelling himself expressed concerns about. Though Kelling’s work was published more than two decades ago the concepts he helped popularize are still widely considered to be influential in modern policing. A 2013 report from the Brennan Center for Justice drew a direct line between “broken windows” policing and NYPD’s “stop and frisk” campaign which ended in 2014 with the mayoral election of Bill de Blasio. (In 2016 Kelling himself said that he rebuked the way “broken windows” and the associated mindset around police discretion enabled cops to enforce laws in a discriminatory fashion.) “Any officer who really wants to do order maintenance has to be able to answer satisfactorily the question ‘Why do you decide to arrest one person who’s urinating in public and not arrest [another]?’” Kelling told Frontline. “And if you can’t answer that question if you just say ‘Well it’s common sense’ you get very very worried.” Meanwhile de Blasio has made half-hearted attempts at guiding the NYPD towards a community policing model over the last four years but folded to police pressure in August by walking back support for a chokehold ban that criminalizes police “sitting kneeling or standing” on a person’s back or chest “in a manner that compresses the diaphragm” during an arrest. De Blasio announced his support for an amendment to the June chokehold ban in response to an NYC PBA lawsuit (filed August 6 along with 18 other unions including the Sergeants Benevolent Association). The PBA then criticized the amendment saying nothing less than a total repeal would be acceptable. In both friendly and potentially fatal situations police unions are firm that their ability to "do [their] jobs safely and effectively" as PBA president Patrick Lynch argued against the chokehold ban rests solely on their own judgement with as few limitations as possible. Cops have serious social incentives to respect PBA cards—the way they handle being presented with one reflects the respect they have for a fellow officer. This dynamic is demonstrated with surprising accuracy Driscoll said in a storyline of The Sopranos. In the 2001 episode “Another Toothpick” Tony Soprano brandishes a New Jersey State PBA card when a Black police officer pulls him over for speeding. “I think I had dinner with your boss last week” Soprano says slyly as he flashes the card (which bears the name of real-life former PBA president Michael J. Madonna). After a tense exchange the officer tickets Soprano anyway. A few scenes later Soprano runs into the cop working at a garden supply store: Once word of his refusal to let Soprano off the hook got back to his superiors the cop’s hours were cut and he was forced to get a second job to recoup the lost income. “I love The Sopranos” Driscoll said. “I laughed at that one!” But he said the potential disrespect communicated by ignoring a fellow cop’s PBA card was no joke. When police officers are presented with a PBA card they need to make a calculated decision about how seriously to take it. “Imagine you're a police officer you're out there doing your job every single time and you give your wife or your brother or your kid the card. You say ‘Just show this to a police officer and he can always call me and I can talk to him.’” Driscoll said. “And then the officer comes home and his [family member] says ‘The police officer said I don't give a shit about that! and gave me a summons.’ You'd be like 'Damn! I'm in the same work as you and you couldn't even extend me a courtesy?’” According to Mike even legitimate PBA cardholders like himself aren’t immune to scorn when they use them. “I've definitely given the card over and seen an eye-roll or two” he said. “They were ready and willing to give the ticket and then when they saw the card they didn't want to deal with either mailing the card back to the person [if they choose to confiscate it] or getting a phone call from another cop… I think that's kind of a no-no in their world.” In the seven to 10 times Mike estimates he's presented cops with PBA cards one instance from earlier this year sticks out in his mind. He said he turned out of a Starbucks parking lot in New Jersey and found himself going the wrong direction on a one-way street. Within seconds a cop across the street sprang into action running up to Mike’s car and ordering him to pull over. Mike picked up on the cop’s aggressive demeanor immediately. “This guy had a really short haircut” Mike said. “He had that mean look that you know right away sucks. Maybe he was just having an off day that day. But I don't think so—I think he was just not a nice guy.” Worried Mike handed over all three PBA cards he had on him in an effort to skirt the ticket. “He took all of them” Mike said something he'd never experienced before. “He basically said ‘If I pull you over again I'm gonna give you a ticket.’ So some of them are not all butterflies and happy when you give them a PBA card.” For all the buddy-buddy connotations PBA cards seem to carry encounters like these underscore the fact that PBA cards aren’t about cops showing respect to civilians; they’re about cops respecting each other. Exhibiting restraint even when they’d rather crack down is easiest for officers when there's an implied social or professional cost—in accepting a PBA card they're ultimately protecting themselves. Police unions tend to be tight-lipped when it comes to discussing PBA cards. The phenomenon is mentioned in the media as early as 1936 in a profile of a former police commissioner in the New Yorker and references to PBA cards continued to crop up in New York–area newspapers throughout the 20th century generally in connection with forgery and extortion. One motorcycle patrolman died by suicide after he was found guilty of distributing fraudulent courtesy cards. But for the most part you’d be hard pressed to get a cop (or even a PBA cardholder) to discuss the custom in detail. Because of this silence it's tough to get a read on how many PBA cards there are in circulation and who exactly is holding them. The NYC PBA caps the number of cards it gives each of its 24000 active members at 20 as of 2019 down from 30 the year before. This was in response to the issue of people selling the cards on eBay as long ago as 2006 (they are still available there as “collectibles” as of this writing). That means there may be up to 480000 PBA cards issued in 2020 currently in circulation from a single union in a single city—a number that does not include cards issued to retired officers. In a 2018 interview with VICE News Tonight a retired NYPD officer told a reporter “I can tell you now from inside experience: They don’t have a clue how many cards are printed because they’re not serialized. They don’t inventory the cards. They just give them out.” “If there's a million of those cards out there think of the police officer!” Driscoll said. There is some interest in limiting the number of available cards so that they maintain their significance. “It gets to the point where it's I have to issue summonses I don't give a damn if you have a card or not.” According to Driscoll PBA cards are just par for the course when it comes to uneven policing based on an individual officer's judgement—he stressed that cops exercise discretion and let people off with warnings all the time PBA card or not. “People can read into it what they want that it's nefarious… it's not that big of a deal” he said. To Wall though courtesy cards are just the opposite: They’re “a window into the larger maze” of the foundational principles of policing like discretion that make the entire institution so unreformable. He believes they reflect the biases prejudices and institutionally supported pecking order of policing on the whole. “Policing was never meant to be held accountable in the first place not in a meaningful substantial way” Wall said. He cautioned against focusing too much on the injustice of PBA cards. “Be careful that the outrage [doesn't] become directed in too narrow a way. The real outrage should be directed at the nature of policing itself.” Correction: This story originally stated that David Correia is an associate professor at the University of Mexico.

It's Official: Women Leaders Dealt With Covid Better,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv8byv/female-leaders-dealt-with-covid-better-than-men,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Countries with women leaders suffered half as many COVID deaths on average compared to countries with male leaders academics have found. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have received praise for their countries’ response to coronavirus while US President Donald Trump has been criticised. But even with the best and worst outliers removed statistical analysis of 194 countries by the University of Liverpool still showed that women leaders performed better. Professor Supriya Garikipati said: “Our results clearly indicate that women leaders reacted more quickly and decisively in the face of potential fatalities. In almost all cases they locked down earlier than male leaders in similar circumstances. “While this may have longer-term economic implications it has certainly helped these countries to save lives as evidenced by the significantly lower number of deaths in these countries.” With only 19 countries out of 194 led by women researchers created “nearest neighbour” countries based on a number of factors such as GDP population population age health expenditure equality and openness to travel. So Leo Varadkar’s Ireland was compared to Jacinda Ardern’s New Zealand; Sheikh Hasina’s Bangladesh was compared to Pakistan led by Arif Alvi; and Ana Brnabić’s Serbia was compared to Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu. Professor Garikipati said: “Nearest neighbour analysis clearly confirms that when women-led countries are compared to countries similar to them along a range of characteristics they have performed better experiencing fewer cases as well as fewer deaths.” Researchers found that women leaders tended to lock their countries down earlier. Rather than an example of gender stereotypes around risk aversion the researchers argue that women leaders were willing to risk their economies to preserve human life. The researchers argue that “having a clear empathetic and decisive communication style made a significant difference to immediate outcomes of the COVID pandemic in women-led countries”. Professor Garkipati said: “Our findings show that COVID outcomes are systematically and significantly better in countries led by women and to some extent this may be explained by the proactive policy responses they adopted. Even accounting for institutional context and other controls being female-led has provided countries with an advantage in the current crisis.” The authors hope that the paper will serve as a “starting point” in the debate about how national leaders affected the pandemic. @SimonChilds13,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv8byv/female-leaders-dealt-with-covid-better-than-men,www.vice.com,1600223579509
The Little Cards That Tell Police 'Let's Forget This Ever Happened',headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7gxa4/pba-card-police-courtesy-cards,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Bearing witness to the historic reckoning with systemic racism and amplifying dialogue to drive change that delivers on the promise of racial equality. Mike a white man in his 50s was in a bad spot: He was stuck idling in traffic on New York City’s Riverside Drive running late for a meeting and he needed to get to the Upper East Side pronto. Hopping on the shoulder to bypass the other cars wasn’t the right thing to do he told VICE but he’d seen other people get away with it before. Mike whose name has been changed to protect his privacy said he knew it was risky—especially because the borrowed car he was driving didn’t have a license plate let alone a registration under his name. He decided to roll the dice anyway. Right away bad news: a traffic checkpoint and cops pulling people over. “That was probably the tightest spot I could've been in” Mike said. “Because [the offense] could've been ‘driving without a plate’ ‘driving with no registration...’" By driving on the shoulder too Mike was driving illegally in at least three different ways. Despite that he felt confident as the cop approached his car and told him to roll down his window. Instead of pulling out his driver’s license Mike simply introduced himself and produced something better. “I just basically happened to have one of their PBA cards on me” he said referring to the small plastic "courtesy" cards issued by the Police Benevolent Association which usually have an officer’s name phone number and signature on the back. The cards are designed to be presented in a low-stakes police encounter like a traffic stop as a laminated wink-and-nudge between officers that says “Hey would you mind going a little easy on this one?” When a cop is handed a PBA card they can call the number on it to verify the relationship between the cardholder and the issuer then decide whether it means they should give the cardholder a break. According to Mike the officer looked at the card then let him go without asking for ID or the car’s registration. "By knowing somebody and having that connection it worked” Mike said. The somebody Mike knew was a U.S. Route 1 patrolman a colleague of the cops who’d pulled him over. Though he didn’t have a license plate or registration he did have proof of that “connection” and it was all he needed to be on his way without any trouble. As he did on that day in 1993 Mike has continued to carry use and benefit from PBA cards for almost three decades. Are you a PBA cardholder or a cop with opinions on discretion? If you have information you would like to share you can reach the reporter directly at katie.way@vice.com or securely via Signal at +1 (571) 205-0611. Though Mike’s story may seem like it comes from a less-scrutinized outdated era of law enforcement PBA cards are still used and accepted in the present without much oversight. They serve as a physical example of how cops are able to exercise the law largely as they feel personally is right. With a few exceptions PBA cards aren’t a normal part of life for most people in the U.S. Though they do confer some privilege and exclusivity the cards aren't exactly a secret. The Police Benevolent Association New York City’s largest police union issues these courtesy cards—nicknamed "get out of jail free cards"—to its members on a yearly basis. Members can pass the cards out to whomever they choose to provide them with a little extra protection. Mike works in an industry that regularly puts him into contact with police officers which gives him the opportunity to form personal trusting relationships with them. As such he said he frequently receives PBA cards as a thank-you for extending cops small business favors and deals; currently he estimates that he has somewhere between 10 and 12 unexpired courtesy cards in his possession. They're ideal for slipping into a wallet alongside other forms of identification. (Driver’s license? Check. Work ID? Check. “I’m friends with a cop” card? Check.) Other New York City police unions like the Detectives’ Endowment Association and the Sergeants Benevolent Association do the same with their own courtesy cards; elsewhere police unions in Philadelphia Los Angeles and Boston have a history of issuing courtesy cards of their own. (The Detectives’ Endowment Association and Sergeants Benevolent Association did not respond to requests for comment. The NYC PBA declined to comment for this story.) According to John Driscoll an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice PBA cards aren’t quite carte blanche to flout the law. Driscoll a former NYPD officer himself told VICE that in his experience the cards are most likely to work in one’s favor during traffic stops for minor infractions like speeding or a busted tail light—and not in more serious cases like drunk driving. When a PBA card is presented it's up to the officer how they want to factor it into a stop. “Some officers I think they'd summons their own mother” Driscoll said. “The card doesn't mean anything to them. Other people [are less that way]; we have wide discretion when it comes to issuing summonses so officers exercise that all the time” he said in order to let PBA cardholders off the hook for minor infractions if they so choose. It may seem inconsequential when that choice means a police officer’s 19-year-old nephew walks away with a warning for running a stop sign in his suburban neighborhood. But because cops can also use discretion to over-apply the law violently to vulnerable populations PBA cards and the privileges they confer are darkly emblematic of how certain people are favored in situations in which others are endangered or hurt by police. The existence of these cards is a concrete example of a larger often more insidious problem in American policing: Discretionary decision-making allows police to pick and choose who the law really applies to—and who gets a pass. “Usually when we think about discretion we think about what cops can do. But on the street it's also who they won't harass who they won't arrest who they choose to let off.” There are countless cases many well-documented of police brutality that have begun with a cop pulling a Black or nonwhite driver over for the type of very routine traffic stop that PBA cards are designed to smooth over. The “broken taillight” infraction has become a trope when it comes to police violence specifically against Black people: In 2016 a Minneapolis police officer killed Philando Castile after pulling him over for a broken taillight; Castile was reportedly pulled over for similar infractions on a regular basis. (The officer in question was later acquitted.) Black Americans have filed lawsuits against police officers in Aurora Colorado and Shreveport Louisiana alleging discriminatory and violent treatment during broken taillight stops fortunately without deadly consequences. In 2015 Sandra Bland was pulled over in Prairie View Texas for failing to signal while changing lanes; after a state trooper threatened her with a stun gun Bland was taken into custody where she was found dead three days later. There are many other accounts of police choosing violence against the people they pull over for minor traffic infractions particularly if they aren't white. To illustrate how discretion permeates issues of policing large and small David Correia an associate professor at the University of New Mexico and co-author of Police: A Field Guide also pointed to over-policing in the “crime-infested” neighborhoods overwhelmingly populated by Black and brown people living at or below the poverty line; and the proven inability of so-called “chokehold bans” to curb the police use of chokeholds. While injustices like these have gradually begun to receive the attention they need the way that cops apply discretion in the other direction—in the form of favoritism toward people who are friendly to police—is a matter that they and their PBA-card-holding associates work to keep quiet especially as it contrasts starkly with the gross mistreatment that people of color receive. “Usually when we think about discretion we think about what cops can do what law permits them to do what law constrains them from doing” Correia said. “But on the street it's also who they won't harass who they won't arrest who they choose to let off.” In separate interviews with VICE Correia and Tyler Wall the other co-author of Police: A Field Guide both emphasized the fact that these cards typify the concept of police discretion. “It does show a certain level of built-in ingrained logic of the police” Wall said: “There are people who should be able to perform their love for the cop in order to get out of a ticket.” In practice Correia and Wall said those who are able to “get off easy” from an encounter with the police typically look and act a lot like Mike an affable white person who respects police authority and is careful to address them with friendly deference—to act the part of the sheepish apologetic innocent who understands that the cop is “just doing their job.” (And given the publicly available data on the demographics of the NYPD and New Jersey state police the majority of police issuing cards are likely white officers.) “The best way to use a PBA card is to not have to use it” Jack a white man in his 30s told VICE. Like Mike Jack works in an industry that brings him in frequent close contact with police officers who occasionally give him PBA cards for a job well done. But Jack also counts cops among his friends and family and he said those relationships have instilled him with an extra sense of responsibility as a PBA card carrier. Jack last used a PBA card in 2019 when he was pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike in the early hours of the morning. “I was speeding” Jack said. “I was doing close to 90 miles an hour. I was probably a good 15 to 20 miles over the speed limit.” When Jack was pulled over—on his way to work with his father a co-worker in the passenger seat—he felt a thrill of nervousness as the cop approached his window. Jack said he’s only used a PBA card three times total and has never felt truly comfortable doing so because he feels cautious almost reverent about the statement he’s making when he displays one. “Whenever I hand that card over to the police officer I’m showing the type of person I am and it’s reflecting off whoever gave me that card” he said. The exchange was brief and friendly. The traffic cop knew the cop whose PBA card Jack handed over so after a quick phone call to confirm Jack obtained the card legitimately the traffic cop let Jack go after issuing him a written warning. “He was still doing his job” Jack said. “But he did let me off from getting a ticket. I have a feeling he gave me the warning because I had the card.” Jack said he didn’t think it would be right to use a PBA card to extract himself from a more serious situation like a bar fight or reckless driving—he wouldn’t want the cop who gave him a PBA card to be implicated in his bad behavior and he also wouldn’t want to pressure a cop attempting to ticket him into bending the rules just because he had a privileged relationship with another law enforcement officer. But at the same time Jack knows what he’s signaling when he shows a cop his PBA card. “In my opinion it’s basically something you hand over to the police officer to show that hey I'm close with this cop. He gave it to me. He wouldn't have given it to me if he didn't trust me” Jack said. “Here it is you know you do what you do with it.” Officer discretion is at the core of modern policing—it vests cops with the power to choose if when how to whom and to what extent they will apply the law. The school resource officers who handcuff disabled children for acting out in class are free to do so because they’ve determined using discretion that it is necessary. The cop who returned a scared naked teenager to Jeffrey Dahmer after the 14-year-old boy escaped the murderer’s house? Also exercising discretion. Literature on discretion that’s favorable to the police effectively states that this decision-making power can’t be limited because to do so would curb their ability to react in the moment and enforce the law. According to the preface of criminologist George L. Kelling’s 1999 report for the Department of Justice on discretion and police training (guided by the still-influential “broken windows” police theory he helped ideate): “We now understand that telling officers only what they cannot do which is so typical of police manuals and rules and regulations has not improved the quality of policing. We know as well that the work world of police is too complex to tell officers exactly what they should do in every circumstance.” Kelling goes on to advocate for training that teaches cops about how to think rather than how to act in the field—how to identify disorder and criminal potential without placing firm limits on how to act once a supposed threat is identified. This mindset has unsurprisingly been linked to racial profiling and the criminalization of unhoused populations something Kelling himself expressed concerns about. Though Kelling’s work was published more than two decades ago the concepts he helped popularize are still widely considered to be influential in modern policing. A 2013 report from the Brennan Center for Justice drew a direct line between “broken windows” policing and NYPD’s “stop and frisk” campaign which ended in 2014 with the mayoral election of Bill de Blasio. (In 2016 Kelling himself said that he rebuked the way “broken windows” and the associated mindset around police discretion enabled cops to enforce laws in a discriminatory fashion.) “Any officer who really wants to do order maintenance has to be able to answer satisfactorily the question ‘Why do you decide to arrest one person who’s urinating in public and not arrest [another]?’” Kelling told Frontline. “And if you can’t answer that question if you just say ‘Well it’s common sense’ you get very very worried.” Meanwhile de Blasio has made half-hearted attempts at guiding the NYPD towards a community policing model over the last four years but folded to police pressure in August by walking back support for a chokehold ban that criminalizes police “sitting kneeling or standing” on a person’s back or chest “in a manner that compresses the diaphragm” during an arrest. De Blasio announced his support for an amendment to the June chokehold ban in response to an NYC PBA lawsuit (filed August 6 along with 18 other unions including the Sergeants Benevolent Association). The PBA then criticized the amendment saying nothing less than a total repeal would be acceptable. In both friendly and potentially fatal situations police unions are firm that their ability to "do [their] jobs safely and effectively" as PBA president Patrick Lynch argued against the chokehold ban rests solely on their own judgement with as few limitations as possible. Cops have serious social incentives to respect PBA cards—the way they handle being presented with one reflects the respect they have for a fellow officer. This dynamic is demonstrated with surprising accuracy Driscoll said in a storyline of The Sopranos. In the 2001 episode “Another Toothpick” Tony Soprano brandishes a New Jersey State PBA card when a Black police officer pulls him over for speeding. “I think I had dinner with your boss last week” Soprano says slyly as he flashes the card (which bears the name of real-life former PBA president Michael J. Madonna). After a tense exchange the officer tickets Soprano anyway. A few scenes later Soprano runs into the cop working at a garden supply store: Once word of his refusal to let Soprano off the hook got back to his superiors the cop’s hours were cut and he was forced to get a second job to recoup the lost income. “I love The Sopranos” Driscoll said. “I laughed at that one!” But he said the potential disrespect communicated by ignoring a fellow cop’s PBA card was no joke. When police officers are presented with a PBA card they need to make a calculated decision about how seriously to take it. “Imagine you're a police officer you're out there doing your job every single time and you give your wife or your brother or your kid the card. You say ‘Just show this to a police officer and he can always call me and I can talk to him.’” Driscoll said. “And then the officer comes home and his [family member] says ‘The police officer said I don't give a shit about that! and gave me a summons.’ You'd be like 'Damn! I'm in the same work as you and you couldn't even extend me a courtesy?’” According to Mike even legitimate PBA cardholders like himself aren’t immune to scorn when they use them. “I've definitely given the card over and seen an eye-roll or two” he said. “They were ready and willing to give the ticket and then when they saw the card they didn't want to deal with either mailing the card back to the person [if they choose to confiscate it] or getting a phone call from another cop… I think that's kind of a no-no in their world.” In the seven to 10 times Mike estimates he's presented cops with PBA cards one instance from earlier this year sticks out in his mind. He said he turned out of a Starbucks parking lot in New Jersey and found himself going the wrong direction on a one-way street. Within seconds a cop across the street sprang into action running up to Mike’s car and ordering him to pull over. Mike picked up on the cop’s aggressive demeanor immediately. “This guy had a really short haircut” Mike said. “He had that mean look that you know right away sucks. Maybe he was just having an off day that day. But I don't think so—I think he was just not a nice guy.” Worried Mike handed over all three PBA cards he had on him in an effort to skirt the ticket. “He took all of them” Mike said something he'd never experienced before. “He basically said ‘If I pull you over again I'm gonna give you a ticket.’ So some of them are not all butterflies and happy when you give them a PBA card.” For all the buddy-buddy connotations PBA cards seem to carry encounters like these underscore the fact that PBA cards aren’t about cops showing respect to civilians; they’re about cops respecting each other. Exhibiting restraint even when they’d rather crack down is easiest for officers when there's an implied social or professional cost—in accepting a PBA card they're ultimately protecting themselves. Police unions tend to be tight-lipped when it comes to discussing PBA cards. The phenomenon is mentioned in the media as early as 1936 in a profile of a former police commissioner in the New Yorker and references to PBA cards continued to crop up in New York–area newspapers throughout the 20th century generally in connection with forgery and extortion. One motorcycle patrolman died by suicide after he was found guilty of distributing fraudulent courtesy cards. But for the most part you’d be hard pressed to get a cop (or even a PBA cardholder) to discuss the custom in detail. Because of this silence it's tough to get a read on how many PBA cards there are in circulation and who exactly is holding them. The NYC PBA caps the number of cards it gives each of its 24000 active members at 20 as of 2019 down from 30 the year before. This was in response to the issue of people selling the cards on eBay as long ago as 2006 (they are still available there as “collectibles” as of this writing). That means there may be up to 480000 PBA cards issued in 2020 currently in circulation from a single union in a single city—a number that does not include cards issued to retired officers. In a 2018 interview with VICE News Tonight a retired NYPD officer told a reporter “I can tell you now from inside experience: They don’t have a clue how many cards are printed because they’re not serialized. They don’t inventory the cards. They just give them out.” “If there's a million of those cards out there think of the police officer!” Driscoll said. There is some interest in limiting the number of available cards so that they maintain their significance. “It gets to the point where it's I have to issue summonses I don't give a damn if you have a card or not.” According to Driscoll PBA cards are just par for the course when it comes to uneven policing based on an individual officer's judgement—he stressed that cops exercise discretion and let people off with warnings all the time PBA card or not. “People can read into it what they want that it's nefarious… it's not that big of a deal” he said. To Wall though courtesy cards are just the opposite: They’re “a window into the larger maze” of the foundational principles of policing like discretion that make the entire institution so unreformable. He believes they reflect the biases prejudices and institutionally supported pecking order of policing on the whole. “Policing was never meant to be held accountable in the first place not in a meaningful substantial way” Wall said. He cautioned against focusing too much on the injustice of PBA cards. “Be careful that the outrage [doesn't] become directed in too narrow a way.

Pakistan Gang Rape Sparks Nationwide Protests After Cop Blames Woman,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzp74/gang-rape-in-pakistan-has-become-a-rallying-point-of-outrage,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Women supporters of Pakistani Islamic political party Jamaat-e-Islami hold demonstrations in the city of Karachi against the gang rape in Lahore and the misogynistic comments made by a senior police chief. Photo by Asif HASSAN/ Getty ImagesOn Saturday September 12 a few hours before she stepped out of her home in Pakistan’s capital city Islamabad Tooba Syed could not help but feel apprehensive. Four days earlier a woman was gang raped at a desolate highway in Lahore—almost 300 kms away (over 180 miles) from Syed’s hometown. The woman who was driving home with her kids at night was apprehended by unidentified “robbers”. They smashed her car window dragged her to the nearby field and raped her “at gunpoint.” They then ran away with cash and jewellery. Some media reported that her children were made to watch. Lahore’s Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Umar Shaikh the chief investigator shifted the blame on the survivor triggering nationwide protests. Syed a 29-year-old dentist and organiser of a political and feminist collective called Women Democratic Front told VICE News that even as women are enraged about the tragedy many fear joining the protests. “It’s not just the survivor who suffers but also the women who stand up for her” said Syed who mobilised the protest in Islamabad. “Imagine that. Women are more scared of getting harassed at a protest about rape.” Protesting women in Pakistan have been attacked in the past most recently on March 8 this year during the Aurat March procession—an annual women’s rights demonstration in Pakistan—where men used bricks stones and sticks on them. Nighat Dad Pakistani lawyer and digital activist told VICE News that protesting against rape in Pakistan is still considered unusual. “The culture of shaming and blaming survivors discourages women to talk about rape and sexual assault” she said. Shaikh’s public statements angered many women in the country who are now demanding his resignation. “Our women should not be allowed to travel like this at 12 at night” he said in one TV news channel interview. Shaikh also said that the survivor should have been accompanied by a man. Patriarchy and misogyny are endemic in South Asian countries. Often these factors prevent women from accessing justice either completely or with their dignity and sanity intact. Women’s rights activists say that allegations of sexual assault are often not taken seriously in the region. The United Nations Women found that the pandemic has increased the instances of violence against women across the world. In Pakistan several women’s rights bodies and collectives came together to mobilise women after this case. Some of the trending hashtags include #MeraJismMeriMarzi (My body my rights) and #motorwayincident. In cities such as Lahore Islamabad and Karachi hundreds of people mostly women gathered gave speeches and raised slogans. Occupying public space is a significant and intentional part of women-led marches in South Asian countries like Pakistan and India. Movements like Aurat March grew from everyday restrictions and onus of crimes being levied on women. “We’re constantly reminded that we do not belong in public space. That we’re not supposed to venture out” said Syed. “Being typecast like what the CCPO said is the reason why many women don’t report crimes against them.” News reports said that the motorway rape survivor was reluctant to report the crime because of the stigma that follows. “Her family reported it” added Syed. “The witnesses were not keen to follow up though.” Activists said that the last time outrage of this scale for rape was seen was in 2018 when a six-year-old girl named Zainab was raped and murdered. A huge public outcry over police not filing a report led to swift action and eventual hanging of the convict. The victim-shaming in the motorway case is also reminiscent of the gang rape of Mukhtaran Mai in 2002 which was followed by then Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf saying that rape accusations are “an easy way to make money”. “The anger is not over this one person (Shaikh). It’s coming from the structural violence against women (VAW) embedded in the society” said Dad. In Lahore Pakistan’s second-largest city the police detained at least 12 people for questioning and are set to do a “mass DNA test” on the population of the village near the site of the attack. The penalty for conviction of gang rape in Pakistan is death or life imprisonment. Human rights reports note that rapes are frequent in the country while prosecutions are rare. Until 2006 women could be charged for adultery if they were raped. In 2020 a report by the Sustainable Social Development Organization revealed an alarming increase in cases of VAW during the COVID-19 pandemic Government officials also reported a 25 percent increase in domestic violence during the COVID-19 lockdown in eastern Punjab province registering 3217 cases between March and May. “In just the last three days I’ve read about five rape cases” said Syed. “A major reason why this protest is gaining momentum is that women are stuck with abuse at home during the pandemic.” Activists familiar with the case said that after the attack the woman tried helpline numbers while waiting for a relative to rescue her in the dead of the night. “The woman was educated enough to know the helpline numbers and still she didn’t get any help. This shows how effective our state machinery is” said Dad. As protests rage on activists also note that this is perhaps the first time in recent history that the identity of the survivor has not been disclosed. “I didn’t see photos of the rape survivor floating around on television channels for the first time or even the FIR with all her details” said Dad adding that she did however find the FIR floating around on WhatsApp groups. Syed added “This country does not deserve to name its survivors simply because they don’t know how to protect them.” Follow Pallavi Pundir on Twitter.,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzp74/gang-rape-in-pakistan-has-become-a-rallying-point-of-outrage,www.vice.com,1600223579509
London's Trans+ Pride Is a Protest,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4ayeqw/londons-trans-pride-is-a-protest,www.vice.com,1600223579509
London’s trans community and their allies turned up in their droves for Trans+ Pride this Saturday with more than three times as many protesters attending compared to last year’s inaugural event. A 5000-strong crowd gathered for the socially distanced occasion marching from Wellington Arch through central London to protest the continued marginalisation of trans non-binary and gender nonconforming people in the UK before congregating at Parliament Square to demand answers and action from the government. While London’s mainstream Pride events might be more parties than protests these days those at Trans+ Pride had plenty to say. Top of the agenda was progressive reform of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) after the government missed its own deadline for responding to 2018’s GRA public consultation. Meanwhile the rights of transgender youth to access healthcare and surgery are increasingly under threat with Equalities Minister Liz Truss commenting in April that under-18s should be “protected from decisions… that are irreversible in the future”. With the Black Lives Matter movement gathering pace over the summer and transgender hate crimes on the rise in the UK Trans+ Pride’s organisers also demanded an end to violence against Black trans women. Speakers paid emotional tributes to their friend Elie Che a trans model and community leader who had recently moved from London to New York and was found dead in the Bronx last month at the age of 23. Organisers made sure that the event followed COVID guidelines throughout dispensing masks and hand sanitiser to the crowd but police soon threatened those on stage with a £10000 fine for organising a gathering of more than 30 people forcing it to end earlier than planned. At such a pivotal time for trans rights in the UK London’s second Trans+ Pride had a sense of urgency. A few attendees shared why they thought it was important to show up. “I’m here because transgender and non-binary people still don’t have the rights we deserve. It might seem like things are changing for the better for us but while there might be a bit more visibility and a few more gender neutral restrooms in certain places I feel like where it counts in politics things are getting worse – and I think they’ll probably continue to get worse before they get better. “We need to be protected in law and it shouldn’t be so difficult to have your gender on documents. So that’s why I’m here. I think one of the only ways to really get what we need is to show up and protest.” – Atrix “I came down today because the landscape for trans gender non-conforming and non-binary people around the world is totally unacceptable. Just this year we’ve seen the GRA plans scrapped so many Black trans people have been murdered in the US Hungary has passed a bill that means trans people can't even self-identify as their real gender anymore and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.” – Prishita “The last year has been really confusing for trans people. We've been waiting for answers from the government after the GRA consultation and we didn't get the answers that we should have got. We all put our voices out there and wanted to be listened to and I don't think we have been so that’s why we’re here to try and get them to listen to us. “I’ve got a big queer family that I want to be here to represent and I thought it was important to be here today to be together to stand up for our rights and to be with all my trans siblings.” – Paddy “I thought it was important to show up today because trans people need to be visible. We need to show that we’re a strong community and stand up for ourselves. I believe we need to be loud and vocal so our needs are taken note of as well as just being more inclusive with each other because there’s strength in numbers and the common thing we share is our trans experience. “I think a lot of people fear transness so they like to put us down or shun us so that we don’t have a voice. We need to show that we’re here we matter and we’re fabulous incredible beings. Embrace us because there’s a lot you can learn from us.” – Conn ‘They’re hurting future generations by not allowing us freedom’ From left to right: Theo and Rex “I’ve been showing up for every Black Lives Matter and Black Trans Lives protest but the reason I’m here today is that the government was supposed to reform the GRA and they haven’t – and the prospects for trans rights in the future now seem definitely worse. Recently they were talking about removing access to support for trans youth up to the age of 18 so I’m here to make sure that the younger generation don’t get fucked over.” – Rex. “It’s about protecting trans kids. If I had known I was trans from an earlier age I would have saved myself so many years of being miserable and not knowing why. Telling kids that they're wrong and that what they're feeling isn't right because they're too young to feel it is bullshit. They’re hurting future generations by not allowing them that freedom.” – Theo. “It's important to have Trans Pride not only to celebrate and show that we're here for each other and that we love each other but to stand against transphobic legislation and to send a message to the government that we’re here to fight back and we won’t take it lying down. “Things are getting significantly worse for trans people here in the UK. For a start the average waiting time to get your first appointment at the Gender Identity Clinic is something like three-and-a-half years now compared to the 18-week average for the NHS overall so even getting basic healthcare is so hard. “Meanwhile the rhetoric that JK Rowling and all of her followers are putting forward is that they're dishing out hormones left right and centre – and it's just not the case. The whole Gender Clinic system needs to be better funded and actually run by queer or trans people so that trans people get the support we need rather than being made to feel like there’s something wrong with us.” – Xoey “I think we need Trans Pride to highlight that our community needs solidarity and compassion. This year there's been a lot of active and aggressive oppression from our government. “We've had the threat of our under-18s being stopped from having access to medical help or surgeries and we've also had unfortunately the communication that we will not be able to self identify our gender [one of the aims of GRA reform]. The Tory government is hiding behind the guise that they are here for our rights that they're here to support our youth when in actual fact they’re leaving so many questions unanswered. “We were promised in 2018 that we would see reform of the GRA but Liz Truss made it very clear back in April that she wouldn’t be here for trans views. There’s a hatred of our community and it’s fuelled by fear and scapegoating. We’re seen as predators or as psychopaths when in reality we’re the most compassionate and loving community there is.” – Alexis. “I'm here to show support and solidarity to our trans siblings. There are so many things from the past that are holding trans people back and a lot needs to change. The Gender Recognition Act should have been amended years ago and I think that’s the first thing that needs to happen urgently. I think there are elements of society that are becoming more understanding but in general we really need more inclusivity. And we need more Gender Clinics. I’m from Manchester and there’s a high population of trans people there so realistically we need one set up there. I want everyone to know that we’re not just here for ourselves we’re here for the queer community because we need to win this fight.” – Jess. From left to right: Lewis and Lucia “Trans Pride is really important because we have an Equalities Minister who doesn’t care about trans people and our equality. We need a progressive reform of the GRA we need to fight for an end to violence against trans people especially Black trans women and we need to see an end to mutilation of intersex children at birth and to give non-binary people the right to legally identify themselves. “From the outside it might look like things are getting better because we have more visibility within the media but actually we’re suffering just as hard. There’s such hysteria that trans people are predators. It’s a fantasy and a fairytale and people who think that have probably never actually met a trans person.” – Lewis. @ro_hew / @heather_glazzard,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4ayeqw/londons-trans-pride-is-a-protest,www.vice.com,1600223579509
It's Official: Women Leaders Dealt With Covid Better,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv8byv/female-leaders-dealt-with-covid-better-than-men,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Countries with women leaders suffered half as many COVID deaths on average compared to countries with male leaders academics have found. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have received praise for their countries’ response to coronavirus while US President Donald Trump has been criticised. But even with the best and worst outliers removed statistical analysis of 194 countries by the University of Liverpool still showed that women leaders performed better. Professor Supriya Garikipati said: “Our results clearly indicate that women leaders reacted more quickly and decisively in the face of potential fatalities. In almost all cases they locked down earlier than male leaders in similar circumstances. “While this may have longer-term economic implications it has certainly helped these countries to save lives as evidenced by the significantly lower number of deaths in these countries.” With only 19 countries out of 194 led by women researchers created “nearest neighbour” countries based on a number of factors such as GDP population population age health expenditure equality and openness to travel. So Leo Varadkar’s Ireland was compared to Jacinda Ardern’s New Zealand; Sheikh Hasina’s Bangladesh was compared to Pakistan led by Arif Alvi; and Ana Brnabić’s Serbia was compared to Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu. Professor Garikipati said: “Nearest neighbour analysis clearly confirms that when women-led countries are compared to countries similar to them along a range of characteristics they have performed better experiencing fewer cases as well as fewer deaths.” Researchers found that women leaders tended to lock their countries down earlier. Rather than an example of gender stereotypes around risk aversion the researchers argue that women leaders were willing to risk their economies to preserve human life. The researchers argue that “having a clear empathetic and decisive communication style made a significant difference to immediate outcomes of the COVID pandemic in women-led countries”. Professor Garkipati said: “Our findings show that COVID outcomes are systematically and significantly better in countries led by women and to some extent this may be explained by the proactive policy responses they adopted. Even accounting for institutional context and other controls being female-led has provided countries with an advantage in the current crisis.” The authors hope that the paper will serve as a “starting point” in the debate about how national leaders affected the pandemic. @SimonChilds13,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv8byv/female-leaders-dealt-with-covid-better-than-men,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Pakistan Gang Rape Sparks Nationwide Protests After Cop Blames Woman,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzp74/gang-rape-in-pakistan-has-become-a-rallying-point-of-outrage,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Women supporters of Pakistani Islamic political party Jamaat-e-Islami hold demonstrations in the city of Karachi against the gang rape in Lahore and the misogynistic comments made by a senior police chief. Photo by Asif HASSAN/ Getty ImagesOn Saturday September 12 a few hours before she stepped out of her home in Pakistan’s capital city Islamabad Tooba Syed could not help but feel apprehensive. Four days earlier a woman was gang raped at a desolate highway in Lahore—almost 300 kms away (over 180 miles) from Syed’s hometown. The woman who was driving home with her kids at night was apprehended by unidentified “robbers”. They smashed her car window dragged her to the nearby field and raped her “at gunpoint.” They then ran away with cash and jewellery. Some media reported that her children were made to watch. Lahore’s Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Umar Shaikh the chief investigator shifted the blame on the survivor triggering nationwide protests. Syed a 29-year-old dentist and organiser of a political and feminist collective called Women Democratic Front told VICE News that even as women are enraged about the tragedy many fear joining the protests. “It’s not just the survivor who suffers but also the women who stand up for her” said Syed who mobilised the protest in Islamabad. “Imagine that. Women are more scared of getting harassed at a protest about rape.” Protesting women in Pakistan have been attacked in the past most recently on March 8 this year during the Aurat March procession—an annual women’s rights demonstration in Pakistan—where men used bricks stones and sticks on them. Nighat Dad Pakistani lawyer and digital activist told VICE News that protesting against rape in Pakistan is still considered unusual. “The culture of shaming and blaming survivors discourages women to talk about rape and sexual assault” she said. Shaikh’s public statements angered many women in the country who are now demanding his resignation. “Our women should not be allowed to travel like this at 12 at night” he said in one TV news channel interview. Shaikh also said that the survivor should have been accompanied by a man. Patriarchy and misogyny are endemic in South Asian countries. Often these factors prevent women from accessing justice either completely or with their dignity and sanity intact. Women’s rights activists say that allegations of sexual assault are often not taken seriously in the region. The United Nations Women found that the pandemic has increased the instances of violence against women across the world. In Pakistan several women’s rights bodies and collectives came together to mobilise women after this case. Some of the trending hashtags include #MeraJismMeriMarzi (My body my rights) and #motorwayincident. In cities such as Lahore Islamabad and Karachi hundreds of people mostly women gathered gave speeches and raised slogans. Occupying public space is a significant and intentional part of women-led marches in South Asian countries like Pakistan and India. Movements like Aurat March grew from everyday restrictions and onus of crimes being levied on women. “We’re constantly reminded that we do not belong in public space. That we’re not supposed to venture out” said Syed. “Being typecast like what the CCPO said is the reason why many women don’t report crimes against them.” News reports said that the motorway rape survivor was reluctant to report the crime because of the stigma that follows. “Her family reported it” added Syed. “The witnesses were not keen to follow up though.” Activists said that the last time outrage of this scale for rape was seen was in 2018 when a six-year-old girl named Zainab was raped and murdered. A huge public outcry over police not filing a report led to swift action and eventual hanging of the convict. The victim-shaming in the motorway case is also reminiscent of the gang rape of Mukhtaran Mai in 2002 which was followed by then Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf saying that rape accusations are “an easy way to make money”. “The anger is not over this one person (Shaikh). It’s coming from the structural violence against women (VAW) embedded in the society” said Dad. In Lahore Pakistan’s second-largest city the police detained at least 12 people for questioning and are set to do a “mass DNA test” on the population of the village near the site of the attack. The penalty for conviction of gang rape in Pakistan is death or life imprisonment. Human rights reports note that rapes are frequent in the country while prosecutions are rare. Until 2006 women could be charged for adultery if they were raped. In 2020 a report by the Sustainable Social Development Organization revealed an alarming increase in cases of VAW during the COVID-19 pandemic Government officials also reported a 25 percent increase in domestic violence during the COVID-19 lockdown in eastern Punjab province registering 3217 cases between March and May. “In just the last three days I’ve read about five rape cases” said Syed. “A major reason why this protest is gaining momentum is that women are stuck with abuse at home during the pandemic.” Activists familiar with the case said that after the attack the woman tried helpline numbers while waiting for a relative to rescue her in the dead of the night. “The woman was educated enough to know the helpline numbers and still she didn’t get any help. This shows how effective our state machinery is” said Dad. As protests rage on activists also note that this is perhaps the first time in recent history that the identity of the survivor has not been disclosed. “I didn’t see photos of the rape survivor floating around on television channels for the first time or even the FIR with all her details” said Dad adding that she did however find the FIR floating around on WhatsApp groups. Syed added “This country does not deserve to name its survivors simply because they don’t know how to protect them.” Follow Pallavi Pundir on Twitter.,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzp74/gang-rape-in-pakistan-has-become-a-rallying-point-of-outrage,www.vice.com,1600223579509
A 17-Year-Old Aspiring Cop Has Been Charged With Murder In Kenosha,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xg8pxj/a-17-year-old-aspiring-cop-has-been-charged-with-murder-in-kenosha,www.vice.com,1600223579509
Warning: Graphic descriptions and video. A 17-year-old aspiring cop has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder for his alleged role in a shooting during a protest in Kenosha Wisconsin on Tuesday night that left two dead and one injured. The suspect was identified as Kyle Rittenhouse of Lake County Illinois. Prosecutors in Lake County filed the charges at noon Wednesday and labelled him a fugitive who “fled the state of Wisconsin with intent to avoid prosecution for that offense.” Tuesday was the third consecutive night of angry protests in Kenosha since police shot Jacob Blake a Black man leaving him paralyzed. Rittenhouse clad in a green t-shirt a cap emblazoned with an American flag and carrying an assault rifle was seen on video at various points of the night. In several graphic videos he’s seen opening fire on protesters; one was shot in the head another in the chest. The victim who survived was shot in the arm. While it’s not immediately clear why Rittenhouse a former police cadet was at the protest his social media indicates an affiliation with “Back the Blue” a pro-police movement. In recent months pro-cop vigilantes have been showing up heavily armed at protests across the country to defend public property often warmly received by local law enforcement. Police interacted with the alleged gunman at various locations in Kenosha throughout the night. In one video Rittenhouse is seen chatting with police who gave him a bottle of water and thanked him for being there. He was also seen in the vicinity of a group of armed militiamen who had tasked themselves with protecting a gas station from damage. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth acknowledged their presence in an interview with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel but said he wasn’t sure if the suspected shooter was affiliated with them. The shooting started around 11.30 p.m. hours after the curfew when a heated confrontation broke out between protesters and the militia men near the gas station. Around that same time gunshots rang out by an auto-body shop a few blocks away. Video shows a group of people running down the street including the man in the green t-shirt who appears to be being chased. He and his pursuer briefly disappear behind parked cars and then gunshots are heard. “He’s got a gun he shot him” the person recording the video is heard saying. Other videos from the scene suggest that there may have been additional gunfire from another direction. Video shows protesters surrounding the victim who is lying on the ground between two cars. Multiple people are using their phones as flashlights trying to figure out where he’s been shot. “In his head in his head — put pressure on it — put pressure come on” one woman says while holding his head near a bullet wound and telling him “keep your eyes open.” Video from another angle shows the man in the green t-shirt standing there on the phone. “I’ve just killed somebody” he says into his phone as he starts to move away. Soon after another video shows a crowd chasing the suspect down the street. “What did he do?” someone asks. “He shot someone!” someone else replies. The man appears to trip and fall. Two protesters run towards him he sits up and shoots them both. One person lies motionless in the street. “Medic!” someone in the crowd cries out. That victim survived and was seen later being treated for a bullet wound in his arm. The apparent shooter meanwhile was seen on video walking away from the scene — his AR-style rifle clearly visible his hands above his head. But Kenosha police who were responding to the reports of gunfire showed no interest in arresting or even questioning the man. Instead they asked him for directions. “Is someone injured straight ahead?” an officer asks him via loudspeaker. “Get out of the road” said another. He even approached an idling police car going up close to the window but then appeared to change his mind and walked away. Brent Ford 24 a photographer witnessed the entire scene. “He had his hands up and they told him to get out of there even though everyone was yelling that he was the shooter” Ford told VICE News. “The police didn’t seem to hear or care what the crowd was saying.” Ford said many in the crowd were armed — not just the militiamen who were standing guard outside a nearby gas station. For example members of the Socialist Rifle Association an armed leftist gun group were present. Other protesters had pistols in holsters. “I had kinda gotten the feeling the police were overwhelmed and didn’t really know what they were doing most of the night” said Ford. Ford had also observed that the militiamen seen earlier appeared to be getting special treatment from the police. “One of the police in the Bearcat was yelling over the LRAD [a speaker system] for everyone press and protesters to disperse” said Ford. “I noticed that group of armed I guess militia or citizens at the gas station behind the police lines weren’t getting told to leave the area and it kind of struck me as weird.” The shooter has meanwhile been hailed as a “hero” by the far-right. “That boy is a patriot” one person wrote on the imageboard 4chan. “Well he became a man today that’s for sure” another commented.

ID Laws and Stigma Are Keeping Some Trans Voters Away From the Polls,headline,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ep4mw7/id-laws-and-stigma-are-keeping-some-trans-voters-away-from-the-polls,www.vice.com,1600223579509
100 years ago American women legally gained the right to vote. Yet today many women and non-binary people in the U.S.—and around the world—still aren't counted at the polls. The 19th in 2020 is a short series about some of the obstacles they face. When Madeleine Croll is working as an election judge somewhere around Hidalgo County in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley she makes sure to let people in her community know. Part of her oath of office as Democratic party precinct chair involved getting trained as an election judge—someone who monitors polling locations around the state solving any disputes that may come up throughout an election day like whether a certain ID is valid or not. Texas’s voter identification law one of the most expensively defended in the country went into effect in 2013 and while it includes no mention of ID gender needing to match gender presentation misguided (and sometimes malicious) poll workers are occasionally known to bloat the law’s jurisdiction. But not when Croll is working. As the first transgender Texan elected to a precinct chair position she’s able to properly interpret what the law says separate that from what some who defend it hopes it will do and make sure everyone who can vote does. Texas is one of 36 states that requires some form of ID to vote. Voter ID laws are an almost exclusively a Republican-led effort a popular way to combat the red herring of rampant voter fraud and in practice a highly effective way to disenfranchise trans and non-white voters. Several studies have found that such laws skew elections toward the right. A study from the UCLA Law School’s Williams Institute published in February 2020 found that “over 378000 voting-eligible transgender people may face barriers to voting due to voter registration requirements and voter ID laws including 81000 who could face disenfranchisement in strict photo ID states.” Trans people of color students people with low incomes and people with disabilities are “likely overrepresented” among those who may face voting barriers in the November election. Strict ID laws which require photo identification are used in eight states mostly throughout the South. (Texas’s law isn’t among them.) As of 2015 only 11 percent of trans people had documentation that matched their name and gender. According to the Williams Institute report there’s no way of predicting how poll workers in strict ID law states will interpret a trans voter’s ID or whether they’ll allow them to vote if their photo doesn’t match their appearance in person. In Harris County the mammoth Texas county in which Houston is located nearly 15 percent of nonvoters told researchers in 2017 that the reason they didn’t go to the polls was out of concern that they lacked the proper ID. Researchers also found that most people who didn’t vote for this reason ultimately did have an acceptable form of identification. One of the Texas voter ID law’s strengths in suppressing votes is the room it leaves for individual interpretation. The list of acceptable forms of identification is clear and brief; only seven are good at the polls including a passport Texas drivers’ license and handgun license. The law also mentions that in situations where a voter’s name on their ID no longer matches the name on the list of registered voters election officers are to determine whether the two are “substantially similar.” Thanks to the 19th Amendment which prohibits denial of the right to vote along gender lines nothing written in the Texas voter ID law mentions gender presentation specifically. But as Croll explained confusion and fear of stigma at the polling place effectively block trans people from voting in every election. Texas's voter ID law has changed several times over the past seven years having been struck down by federal courts and then revised by the state legislature. Because of that Croll said she believes some poll workers are simply confused when a trans voter walks into their location with an ID that doesn’t match the list of registered voters or a gender presentation that doesn’t match their ID marker. “I see the way the voter ID law in particular makes trans people nervous and impacts their ability to vote in the state all the time” said Ash Hall digital coordinator with the Texas Civil Rights Project. “When you have a law that’s intended to disenfranchise people of course it’s going to affect the transgender community because there are trans people in every kind of community.” Hall emphasized the gray space in the law which leaves far too much room for poll workers to interpret valid identification on the fly. “There’s nothing in the ID law about gender markers but so many trans people are scared that once their marker is changed on their drivers’ license they’re going to have trouble at the poll” Hall said. “And to an extent that’s actually true because even though there’s nothing in the law about that a lot of poll workers think that’s something they need to be wary of when a trans person walks in and presents that ID.” Hall said trans people in Texas are disincentivized from going through the bureaucratic rigmarole necessary to update their ID which itself introduces an entire maze of discriminatory policies. A court order is required to change gender markers on ID in the state an expensive process that usually requires the help of a lawyer. The most recent available data from Texas’s Department of State Health Services suggests that less than 1 percent of trans Texans have successfully updated their birth certificates (the context for this data was the state’s proposed “bathroom bill” which would have required Texans to use the restroom that matches the gender on their birth certificate). “Getting legal IDs is sometimes a bit of an issue for us” Croll said. “Imagine how weird it is that we live our lives as ourselves and then when you want to go practice your right as an American citizen to cast a ballot you have this person looking at you and you wonder are they going to challenge my ballot or say ‘You don’t look like this person?’” Once when Croll was working as an election judge a trans woman with a court-ordered name change that didn’t match her name on the registered voter list came to her polling location. “The clerk brought it to me and the question was ‘Can she vote?’” Croll said. “I was able to say ‘Yes no problem’ and then ‘I’m sorry you have to vote under your dead name but you can vote.’ The scary thing for me is: How many people might have that happen or won’t even go vote because they’re afraid of facing that challenge?” Croll added that she can name at least a dozen people she knows who won't vote over those exact fears. After a federal appellate court ruled the original Texas voter ID law to have a discriminatory effect in 2016 the state amended the law by adding an option for people who lack an acceptable ID to submit an affidavit explaining why (a much more arduous process than voting). But any finding of a false statement in these affidavits can be met with criminal penalties further scaring off people who are already unsure about the validity of their ID. Ultimately a person’s voting experience comes down to the poll workers at the voting location and how well-versed they are in the voter ID law and the ways in which it’s designed to leave out trans voters. “There has to be a level of education that happens especially [for poll workers] living somewhere that isn’t actively making strides to get to know the community” Hall said. “I don’t think trans people are having as many issues in Austin as they are in Brenham or even Dallas for that matter because Austin is a city that has made quite the effort to be inclusive and account for trans people.” Though even the idea that Austin is a haven for trans people in Texas is a bit of a misconception; Texas routinely has the highest rates of violence against trans people in the country and before the Supreme Court ruling in June 2020 Texas was among the states that didn’t explicitly offer protections against discrimination for the LGBTQ community. “It’s a traumatic experience to stand there and hear that poll workers are yelling across to somebody else that they can’t figure out how to proceed and outing someone to the entire line” said Emmett Schilling executive director of the Transgender Education Network of Texas about the anxieties around voting as a trans person in Texas. “I think people don’t understand how dehumanizing it is.” Something both Schilling and Hall focus on in their work around the state is educating trans voters on their rights at the polls making sure people know which forms of ID are allowed which aren’t and what can be done in the event of voter suppression over a form of ID. Schilling’s organization is also focused on educating poll workers throughout the state so voters can have a uniform experience rather than chancing their ability to vote based on their polling place. They also both bristle at the idea of moving somewhere else to a more progressive state with less discriminatory laws. “Texas can be known for being intolerant and ignorant but we have millions of people who are incredible and compassionate” Hall said. “I want to make life better for all of these folks that have to put up with a lot of intolerance and ignorance. Texas also has so much sway in terms of the way that the rest of the nation falls. So if we're able to make progress in this state it bolsters the progressive movement across the country.”,body,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ep4mw7/id-laws-and-stigma-are-keeping-some-trans-voters-away-from-the-polls,www.vice.com,1600223579509
How Climate Migration Will Reshape America,headline,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/15/magazine/climate-crisis-migration-america.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509
August besieged California with a heat unseen in generations. A surge in air-conditioning broke the state’s electrical grid leaving a population already ravaged by the coronavirus to work remotely by the dim light of their cellphones. By midmonth the state had recorded possibly the hottest temperature ever measured on earth — 130 degrees in Death Valley — and an otherworldly storm of lightning had cracked open the sky. From Santa Cruz to Lake Tahoe thousands of bolts of electricity exploded down onto withered grasslands and forests some of them already hollowed out by climate-driven infestations of beetles and kiln-dried by the worst five-year drought on record. Soon California was on fire. Over the next two weeks 900 blazes incinerated six times as much land as all the state’s 2019 wildfires combined forcing 100000 people from their homes. Three of the largest fires in history burned simultaneously in a ring around the San Francisco Bay Area. Another fire burned just 12 miles from my home in Marin County. I watched as towering plumes of smoke billowed from distant hills in all directions and air tankers crisscrossed the skies. Like many Californians I spent those weeks worrying about what might happen next wondering how long it would be before an inferno of 60-foot flames swept up the steep grassy hillside on its way toward my own house rehearsing in my mind what my family would do to escape. But I also had a longer-term question about what would happen once this unprecedented fire season ended. Was it finally time to leave for good? I had an unusual perspective on the matter. For two years I have been studying how climate change will influence global migration. My sense was that of all the devastating consequences of a warming planet — changing landscapes pandemics mass extinctions — the potential movement of hundreds of millions of climate refugees across the planet stands to be among the most important. I traveled across four countries to witness how rising temperatures were driving climate refugees away from some of the poorest and hottest parts of the world. I had also helped create an enormous computer simulation to analyze how global demographics might shift and now I was working on a data-mapping project about migration here in the United States. So it was with some sense of recognition that I faced the fires these last few weeks. In recent years summer has brought a season of fear to California with ever-worsening wildfires closing in. But this year felt different. The hopelessness of the pattern was now clear and the pandemic had already uprooted so many Americans. Relocation no longer seemed like such a distant prospect. Like the subjects of my reporting climate change had found me its indiscriminate forces erasing all semblance of normalcy. Suddenly I had to ask myself the very question I’d been asking others: Was it time to move? I am far from the only American facing such questions. This summer has seen more fires more heat more storms — all of it making life increasingly untenable in larger areas of the nation. Already droughts regularly threaten food crops across the West while destructive floods inundate towns and fields from the Dakotas to Maryland collapsing dams in Michigan and raising the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Rising seas and increasingly violent hurricanes are making thousands of miles of American shoreline nearly uninhabitable. As California burned Hurricane Laura pounded the Louisiana coast with 150-mile-an-hour winds killing at least 25 people; it was the 12th named storm to form by that point in 2020 another record. Phoenix meanwhile endured 53 days of 110-degree heat — 20 more days than the previous record. For years Americans have avoided confronting these changes in their own backyards. The decisions we make about where to live are distorted not just by politics that play down climate risks but also by expensive subsidies and incentives aimed at defying nature. In much of the developing world vulnerable people will attempt to flee the emerging perils of global warming seeking cooler temperatures more fresh water and safety. But here in the United States people have largely gravitated toward environmental danger building along coastlines from New Jersey to Florida and settling across the cloudless deserts of the Southwest. <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/magazine/20mag-Climate2-Images-02/20mag-Climate2-Images-02-master1050.jpg"> AZUSA CALIF. Zach Leisure a firefighter working to contain the Ranch 2 Fire last month. I wanted to know if this was beginning to change. Might Americans finally be waking up to how climate is about to transform their lives? And if so — if a great domestic relocation might be in the offing — was it possible to project where we might go? To answer these questions I interviewed more than four dozen experts: economists and demographers climate scientists and insurance executives architects and urban planners and I mapped out the danger zones that will close in on Americans over the next 30 years. The maps for the first time combined exclusive climate data from the Rhodium Group an independent data-analytics firm; wildfire projections modeled by United States Forest Service researchers and others; and data about America’s shifting climate niches an evolution of work first published by The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last spring. (See a detailed analysis of the maps.) What I found was a nation on the cusp of a great transformation. Across the United States some 162 million people — nearly one in two — will most likely experience a decline in the quality of their environment namely more heat and less water. For 93 million of them the changes could be particularly severe and by 2070 our analysis suggests if carbon emissions rise at extreme levels at least four million Americans could find themselves living at the fringe in places decidedly outside the ideal niche for human life. The cost of resisting the new climate reality is mounting. Florida officials have already acknowledged that defending some roadways against the sea will be unaffordable. And the nation’s federal flood-insurance program is for the first time requiring that some of its payouts be used to retreat from climate threats across the country. It will soon prove too expensive to maintain the status quo. By 2070 some 28 million people across the country could face Manhattan-size megafires. In Northern California they could become an annual event. A megafire on average every … *High Emissions scenario Then what? One influential 2018 study published in The Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists suggests that one in 12 Americans in the Southern half of the country will move toward California the Mountain West or the Northwest over the next 45 years because of climate influences alone. Such a shift in population is likely to increase poverty and widen the gulf between the rich and the poor. It will accelerate rapid perhaps chaotic urbanization of cities ill-equipped for the burden testing their capacity to provide basic services and amplifying existing inequities. It will eat away at prosperity dealing repeated economic blows to coastal rural and Southern regions which could in turn push entire communities to the brink of collapse. This process has already begun in rural Louisiana and coastal Georgia where low-income and Black and Indigenous communities face environmental change on top of poor health and extreme poverty. Mobility itself global-migration experts point out is often a reflection of relative wealth and as some move many others will be left behind. Those who stay risk becoming trapped as the land and the society around them ceases to offer any more support. There are signs that the message is breaking through. Half of Americans now rank climate as a top political priority up from roughly one-third in 2016 and three out of four now describe climate change as either “a crisis” or “a major problem.” This year Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa where tens of thousands of acres of farmland flooded in 2019 ranked climate second only to health care as an issue. A poll by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities found that even Republicans’ views are shifting: One in three now think climate change should be declared a national emergency. Policymakers having left America unprepared for what’s next now face brutal choices about which communities to save — often at exorbitant costs — and which to sacrifice. Their decisions will almost inevitably make the nation more divided with those worst off relegated to a nightmare future in which they are left to fend for themselves. Nor will these disruptions wait for the worst environmental changes to occur. The wave begins when individual perception of risk starts to shift when the environmental threat reaches past the least fortunate and rattles the physical and financial security of broader wealthier parts of the population. It begins when even places like California’s suburbs are no longer safe. <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/magazine/20mag-Climate2-Images-06/20mag-Climate2-Images-06-master1050.jpg"> LAKE CHARLES LA.

A woman lost consciousness in a parking lot after Hurricane Laura left her without electricity or air-conditioning for several days. Let’s start with some basics. Across the country it’s going to get hot. Buffalo may feel in a few decades like Tempe Ariz. does today and Tempe itself will sustain 100-degree average summer temperatures by the end of the century. Extreme humidity from New Orleans to northern Wisconsin will make summers increasingly unbearable turning otherwise seemingly survivable heat waves into debilitating health threats. Fresh water will also be in short supply not only in the West but also in places like Florida Georgia and Alabama where droughts now regularly wither cotton fields. By 2040 according to federal government projections extreme water shortages will be nearly ubiquitous west of Missouri. The Memphis Sands Aquifer a crucial water supply for Mississippi Tennessee Arkansas and Louisiana is already overdrawn by hundreds of millions of gallons a day. Much of the Ogallala Aquifer — which supplies nearly a third of the nation’s irrigation groundwater — could be gone by the end of the century. It can be difficult to see the challenges clearly because so many factors are in play. At least 28 million Americans are likely to face megafires like the ones we are now seeing in California in places like Texas and Florida and Georgia. At the same time 100 million Americans — largely in the Mississippi River Basin from Louisiana to Wisconsin — will increasingly face humidity so extreme that working outside or playing school sports could cause heatstroke. Crop yields will be decimated from Texas to Alabama and all the way north through Oklahoma and Kansas and into Nebraska. By 2060 in Missouri and throughout the Midwest people will experience weeks of “wet-bulb” temperatures above 82 degrees a humidity threshold that makes outdoor labor dangerous. Wet-bulb temperature above 82 degrees … *High Emissions scenario The challenges are so widespread and so interrelated that Americans seeking to flee one could well run into another. I live on a hilltop 400 feet above sea level and my home will never be touched by rising waters. But by the end of this century if the more extreme projections of eight to 10 feet of sea-level rise come to fruition the shoreline of San Francisco Bay will move three miles closer to my house as it subsumes some 166 square miles of land including a high school a new county hospital and the store where I buy groceries. The freeway to San Francisco will need to be raised and to the east a new bridge will be required to connect the community of Point Richmond to the city of Berkeley. The Latino Asian and Black communities who live in the most-vulnerable low-lying districts will be displaced first but research from Mathew Hauer a sociologist at Florida State University who published some of the first modeling of American climate migration in the journal Nature Climate Change in 2017 suggests that the toll will eventually be far more widespread: Nearly one in three people here in Marin County will leave part of the roughly 700000 who his models suggest may abandon the broader Bay Area as a result of sea-level rise alone. From Maine to North Carolina to Texas rising sea levels are not just chewing up shorelines but also raising rivers and swamping the subterranean infrastructure of coastal communities making a stable life there all but impossible. Coastal high points will be cut off from roadways amenities and escape routes and even far inland saltwater will seep into underground drinking-water supplies. Eight of the nation’s 20 largest metropolitan areas — Miami New York and Boston among them — will be profoundly altered indirectly affecting some 50 million people. Imagine large concrete walls separating Fort Lauderdale condominiums from a beachless waterfront or dozens of new bridges connecting the islands of Philadelphia. Not every city can spend $100 billion on a sea wall as New York most likely will. Barrier islands? Rural areas along the coast without a strong tax base? They are likely in the long term unsalvageable. In all Hauer projects that 13 million Americans will be forced to move away from submerged coastlines. Add to that the people contending with wildfires and other risks and the number of Americans who might move — though difficult to predict precisely — could easily be tens of millions larger. Even 13 million climate migrants though would rank as the largest migration in North American history. The Great Migration — of six million Black Americans out of the South from 1916 to 1970 — transformed almost everything we know about America from the fate of its labor movement to the shape of its cities to the sound of its music. What would it look like when twice that many people moved? What might change? <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/magazine/20mag-Climate2-Digital-Extras-03/20mag-Climate2-Digital-Extras-03-master1050.jpg"> COOLIDGE ARIZ. Marisela Felix set up a pool to keep her daughters and niece cool during 108-degree heat. Americans have been conditioned not to respond to geographical climate threats as people in the rest of the world do. It is natural that rural Guatemalans or subsistence farmers in Kenya facing drought or scorching heat would seek out someplace more stable and resilient. Even a subtle environmental change — a dry well say — can mean life or death and without money to address the problem migration is often simply a question of survival. By comparison Americans are richer often much richer and more insulated from the shocks of climate change. They are distanced from the food and water sources they depend on and they are part of a culture that sees every problem as capable of being solved by money. So even as the average flow of the Colorado River — the water supply for 40 million Western Americans and the backbone of the nation’s vegetable and cattle farming — has declined for most of the last 33 years the population of Nevada has doubled. At the same time more than 1.5 million people have moved to the Phoenix metro area despite its dependence on that same river (and the fact that temperatures there now regularly hit 115 degrees). Since Hurricane Andrew devastated Florida in 1992 — and even as that state has become a global example of the threat of sea-level rise — more than five million people have moved to Florida’s shorelines driving a historic boom in building and real estate. Sea-level rise could displace as many as 13 million coastal residents by 2060 including 290000 people in North Carolina. Percent of properties below high tide … *High Emissions scenario Similar patterns are evident across the country. Census data show us how Americans move: toward heat toward coastlines toward drought regardless of evidence of increasing storms and flooding and other disasters. The sense that money and technology can overcome nature has emboldened Americans. Where money and technology fail though it inevitably falls to government policies — and government subsidies — to pick up the slack. Thanks to federally subsidized canals for example water in part of the Desert Southwest costs less than it does in Philadelphia. The federal National Flood Insurance Program has paid to rebuild houses that have flooded six times over in the same spot. And federal agriculture aid withholds subsidies from farmers who switch to drought-resistant crops while paying growers to replant the same ones that failed. Farmers seed manufacturers real estate developers and a few homeowners benefit at least momentarily but the gap between what the climate can destroy and what money can replace is growing. Perhaps no market force has proved more influential — and more misguided — than the nation’s property-insurance system. From state to state readily available and affordable policies have made it attractive to buy or replace homes even where they are at high risk of disasters systematically obscuring the reality of the climate threat and fooling many Americans into thinking that their decisions are safer than they actually are. Part of the problem is that most policies look only 12 months into the future ignoring long-term trends even as insurance availability influences development and drives people’s long-term decision-making. Even where insurers have tried to withdraw policies or raise rates to reduce climate-related liabilities state regulators have forced them to provide affordable coverage anyway simply subsidizing the cost of underwriting such a risky policy or in some cases offering it themselves. The regulations — called Fair Access to Insurance Requirements — are justified by developers and local politicians alike as economic lifeboats “of last resort” in regions where climate change threatens to interrupt economic growth. While they do protect some entrenched and vulnerable communities the laws also satisfy the demand of wealthier homeowners who still want to be able to buy insurance. <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/magazine/20mag-Climate2-Images-07/20mag-Climate2-Images-07-master1050.jpg"> LAKE CHARLES LA. Cassidy Plaisance surveying what was left of her friend’s home after Hurricane Laura. At least 30 states including Louisiana Massachusetts North Carolina and Texas have developed so-called FAIR plans and today they serve as a market backstop in the places facing the highest risks of climate-driven disasters including coastal flooding hurricanes and wildfires. In an era of climate change though such policies amount to a sort of shell game meant to keep growth going even when other obvious signs and scientific research suggest that it should stop. That’s what happened in Florida. Hurricane Andrew reduced parts of cities to landfill and cost insurers nearly $16 billion in payouts. Many insurance companies recognizing the likelihood that it would happen again declined to renew policies and left the state. So the Florida Legislature created a state-run company to insure properties itself preventing both an exodus and an economic collapse by essentially pretending that the climate vulnerabilities didn’t exist. As a result Florida’s taxpayers by 2012 had assumed liabilities worth some $511 billion — more than seven times the state’s total budget — as the value of coastal property topped $2.8 trillion. Another direct hurricane risked bankrupting the state. Florida concerned that it had taken on too much risk has since scaled back its self-insurance plan. But the development that resulted is still in place. On a sweltering afternoon last October with the skies above me full of wildfire smoke I called Jesse Keenan an urban-planning and climate-change specialist then at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design who advises the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission on market hazards from climate change. Keenan who is now an associate professor of real estate at Tulane University’s School of Architecture had been in the news last year for projecting where people might move to — suggesting that Duluth Minn. for instance should brace for a coming real estate boom as climate migrants move north. But like other scientists I’d spoken with Keenan had been reluctant to draw conclusions about where these migrants would be driven from. Last fall though as the previous round of fires ravaged California his phone began to ring with private-equity investors and bankers all looking for his read on the state’s future. Their interest suggested a growing investor-grade nervousness about swiftly mounting environmental risk in the hottest real estate markets in the country. It’s an early sign he told me that the momentum is about to switch directions. “And once this flips” he added “it’s likely to flip very quickly.” <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/magazine/20mag-Climate2-Images-04/20mag-Climate2-Images-04-master1050.jpg"> AZUSA CALIF. Residents watching the Ranch 2 Fire. In fact the correction — a newfound respect for the destructive power of nature coupled with a sudden disavowal of Americans’ appetite for reckless development — had begun two years earlier when a frightening surge in disasters offered a jolting preview of how the climate crisis was changing the rules. On October 9 2017 a wildfire blazed through the suburban blue-collar neighborhood of Coffey Park in Santa Rosa Calif. virtually in my own backyard. I awoke to learn that more than 1800 buildings were reduced to ashes less than 35 miles from where I slept. Inchlong cinders had piled on my windowsills like falling snow. The Tubbs Fire as it was called shouldn’t have been possible. Coffey Park is surrounded not by vegetation but by concrete and malls and freeways. So insurers had rated it as “basically zero risk” according to Kevin Van Leer then a risk modeler from the global insurance liability firm Risk Management Solutions. (He now does similar work for Cape Analytics.) But Van Leer who had spent seven years picking through the debris left by disasters to understand how insurers could anticipate — and price — the risk of their happening again had begun to see other “impossible” fires. After a 2016 fire tornado ripped through northern Canada and a firestorm consumed Gatlinburg Tenn. he said “alarm bells started going off” for the insurance industry. What Van Leer saw when he walked through Coffey Park a week after the Tubbs Fire changed the way he would model and project fire risk forever. Typically fire would spread along the ground burning maybe 50 percent of structures. In Santa Rosa more than 90 percent had been leveled. “The destruction was complete” he told me. Van Leer determined that the fire had jumped through the forest canopy spawning 70-mile-per-hour winds that kicked a storm of embers into the modest homes of Coffey Park which burned at an acre a second as homes ignited spontaneously from the radiant heat. It was the kind of thing that might never have been possible if California’s autumn winds weren’t getting fiercer and drier every year colliding with intensifying climate-driven heat and ever-expanding development. “It’s hard to forecast something you’ve never seen before” he said. <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/magazine/20mag-Climate2-Digital-Extras-04/20mag-Climate2-Digital-Extras-04-master1050.jpg"> SANTA ROSA CALIF.

Homes are being rebuilt in Coffey Park a community destroyed by the Tubbs Fire. For me the awakening to imminent climate risk came with California’s rolling power blackouts last fall — an effort to pre-emptively avoid the risk of a live wire sparking a fire — which showed me that all my notional perspective about climate risk and my own life choices were on a collision course. After the first one all the food in our refrigerator was lost. When power was interrupted six more times in three weeks we stopped trying to keep it stocked. All around us small fires burned. Thick smoke produced fits of coughing. Then as now I packed an ax and a go-bag in my car ready to evacuate. As former Gov. Jerry Brown said it was beginning to feel like the “new abnormal.” It was no surprise then that California’s property insurers — having watched 26 years’ worth of profits dissolve over 24 months — began dropping policies or that California’s insurance commissioner trying to slow the slide placed a moratorium on insurance cancellations for parts of the state in 2020. In February the Legislature introduced a bill compelling California to in the words of one consumer advocacy group “follow the lead of Florida” by mandating that insurance remain available in this case with a requirement that homeowners first harden their properties against fire. At the same time participation in California’s FAIR plan for catastrophic fires has grown by at least 180 percent since 2015 and in Santa Rosa houses are being rebuilt in the very same wildfire-vulnerable zones that proved so deadly in 2017. Given that a new study projects a 20 percent increase in extreme-fire-weather days by 2035 such practices suggest a special form of climate negligence. It’s only a matter of time before homeowners begin to recognize the unsustainability of this approach. Market shock when driven by the sort of cultural awakening to risk that Keenan observes can strike a neighborhood like an infectious disease with fear spreading doubt — and devaluation — from door to door. It happened that way in the foreclosure crisis. By 2060 in Florida and elsewhere the costs of sea-level rise and hurricanes will be compounded by knock-on economic challenges from growing crime to falling productivity. Economic damages as a proportion of G.D.P. … *High Emissions scenario Keenan calls the practice of drawing arbitrary lending boundaries around areas of perceived environmental risk “bluelining” and indeed many of the neighborhoods that banks are bluelining are the same as the ones that were hit by the racist redlining practice in days past. This summer climate-data analysts at the First Street Foundation released maps showing that 70 percent more buildings in the United States were vulnerable to flood risk than previously thought; most of the underestimated risk was in low-income neighborhoods. Such neighborhoods see little in the way of flood-prevention investment. My Bay Area neighborhood on the other hand has benefited from consistent investment in efforts to defend it against the ravages of climate change. That questions of livability had reached me here were testament to Keenan’s belief that the bluelining phenomenon will eventually affect large majorities of equity-holding middle-class Americans too with broad implications for the overall economy starting in the nation’s largest state. Under the radar a new class of dangerous debt — climate-distressed mortgage loans — might already be threatening the financial system. Lending data analyzed by Keenan and his co-author Jacob Bradt for a study published in the journal Climatic Change in June shows that small banks are liberally making loans on environmentally threatened homes but then quickly passing them along to federal mortgage backers. At the same time they have all but stopped lending money for the higher-end properties worth too much for the government to accept suggesting that the banks are knowingly passing climate liabilities along to taxpayers as stranded assets. Once home values begin a one-way plummet it’s easy for economists to see how entire communities spin out of control. The tax base declines and the school system and civic services falter creating a negative feedback loop that pushes more people to leave. Rising insurance costs and the perception of risk force credit-rating agencies to downgrade towns making it more difficult for them to issue bonds and plug the springing financial leaks. Local banks meanwhile keep securitizing their mortgage debt sloughing off their own liabilities. Keenan though had a bigger point: All the structural disincentives that had built Americans’ irrational response to the climate risk were now reaching their logical endpoint. A pandemic-induced economic collapse will only heighten the vulnerabilities and speed the transition reducing to nothing whatever thin margin of financial protection has kept people in place. Until now the market mechanisms had essentially socialized the consequences of high-risk development. But as the costs rise — and the insurers quit and the bankers divest and the farm subsidies prove too wasteful and so on — the full weight of responsibility will fall on individual people. And that’s when the real migration might begin. As I spoke with Keenan last year I looked out my own kitchen window onto hillsides of parkland singed brown by months of dry summer heat. This was precisely the land that my utility Pacific Gas & Electric had three times identified as such an imperiled tinderbox that it had to shut off power to avoid fire. It was precisely the kind of wildland-urban interface that all the studies I read blamed for heightening Californians’ exposure to climate risks. I mentioned this on the phone and then asked Keenan “Should I be selling my house and getting — ” <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/magazine/20mag-Climate2-Images-05/20mag-Climate2-Images-05-master1050.jpg"> PINAL COUNTY ARIZ. Pedro Delgado harvesting a cob of blue corn that grew without kernels at Ramona Farms last month. Americans have dealt with climate disaster before. The Dust Bowl started after the federal government expanded the Homestead Act to offer more land to settlers willing to work the marginal soil of the Great Plains. Millions took up the invitation replacing hardy prairie grass with thirsty crops like corn wheat and cotton. Then entirely predictably came the drought. From 1929 to 1934 crop yields across Texas Oklahoma Kansas and Missouri plunged by 60 percent leaving farmers destitute and exposing the now-barren topsoil to dry winds and soaring temperatures. The resulting dust storms some of them taller than skyscrapers buried homes whole and blew as far east as Washington. The disaster propelled an exodus of some 2.5 million people mostly to the West where newcomers — “Okies” not just from Oklahoma but also Texas Arkansas and Missouri — unsettled communities and competed for jobs. Colorado tried to seal its border from the climate refugees; in California they were funneled into squalid shanty towns. Only after the migrants settled and had years to claw back a decent life did some towns bounce back stronger. The places migrants left behind never fully recovered. Eighty years later Dust Bowl towns still have slower economic growth and lower per capita income than the rest of the country. Dust Bowl survivors and their children are less likely to go to college and more likely to live in poverty. Climatic change made them poor and it has kept them poor ever since. A Dust Bowl event will most likely happen again. The Great Plains states today provide nearly half of the nation’s wheat sorghum and cattle and much of its corn; the farmers and ranchers there export that food to Africa South America and Asia. Crop yields though will drop sharply with every degree of warming. By 2050 researchers at the University of Chicago and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies found Dust Bowl-era yields will be the norm even as demand for scarce water jumps by as much as 20 percent. Another extreme drought would drive near-total crop losses worse than the Dust Bowl kneecapping the broader economy. At that point the authors write “abandonment is one option.” Corn and soy production will decrease with every degree of warming. By 2060 parts of Texas may experience a drop in yields of more than 92 percent. Crop yield decline by: *High Emissions scenario Projections are inherently imprecise but the gradual changes to America’s cropland — plus the steady baking and burning and flooding — suggest that we are already witnessing a slower-forming but much larger replay of the Dust Bowl that will destroy more than just crops. In 2017 Solomon Hsiang a climate economist at the University of California Berkeley led an analysis of the economic impact of climate-driven changes like rising mortality and rising energy costs finding that the poorest counties in the United States — mostly across the South and the Southwest — will in some extreme cases face damages equal to more than a third of their gross domestic products. The 2018 National Climate Assessment also warns that the U.S. economy over all could contract by 10 percent. That kind of loss typically drives people toward cities and researchers expect that trend to continue after the Covid-19 pandemic ends. In 1950 less than 65 percent of Americans lived in cities. By 2050 only 10 percent will live outside them in part because of climatic change. By 2100 Hauer estimates Atlanta Orlando Houston and Austin could each receive more than a quarter million new residents as a result of sea-level displacement alone meaning it may be those cities — not the places that empty out — that wind up bearing the brunt of America’s reshuffling. The World Bank warns that fast-moving climate urbanization leads to rising unemployment competition for services and deepening poverty. So what will happen to Atlanta — a metro area of 5.8 million people that may lose its water supply to drought and that our data also shows will face an increase in heat-driven wildfires? Hauer estimates that hundreds of thousands of climate refugees will move into the city by 2100 swelling its population and stressing its infrastructure. Atlanta — where poor transportation and water systems contributed to the state’s C+ infrastructure grade last year — already suffers greater income inequality than any other large American city making it a virtual tinderbox for social conflict. One in 10 households earns less than $10000 a year and rings of extreme poverty are growing on its outskirts even as the city center grows wealthier. Atlanta has started bolstering its defenses against climate change but in some cases this has only exacerbated divisions. When the city converted an old Westside rock quarry into a reservoir part of a larger greenbelt to expand parkland clean the air and protect against drought the project also fueled rapid upscale growth driving the poorest Black communities further into impoverished suburbs. That Atlanta hasn’t “fully grappled with” such challenges now says Na’Taki Osborne Jelks chair of the West Atlanta Watershed Alliance means that with more people and higher temperatures “the city might be pushed to what’s manageable.” So might Philadelphia Chicago Washington Boston and other cities with long-neglected systems suddenly pressed to expand under increasingly adverse conditions. <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/magazine/20mag-Climate2-Images-08/20mag-Climate2-Images-08-master1050.jpg"> PHOENIX.

Bobby Avent at a cooling center for senior citizens last month. Once you accept that climate change is fast making large parts of the United States nearly uninhabitable the future looks like this: With time the bottom half of the country grows inhospitable dangerous and hot. Something like a tenth of the people who live in the South and the Southwest — from South Carolina to Alabama to Texas to Southern California — decide to move north in search of a better economy and a more temperate environment. Those who stay behind are disproportionately poor and elderly. In these places heat alone will cause as many as 80 additional deaths per 100000 people — the nation’s opioid crisis by comparison produces 15 additional deaths per 100000. The most affected people meanwhile will pay 20 percent more for energy and their crops will yield half as much food or in some cases virtually none at all. That collective burden will drag down regional incomes by roughly 10 percent amounting to one of the largest transfers of wealth in American history as people who live farther north will benefit from that change and see their fortunes rise. The millions of people moving north will mostly head to the cities of the Northeast and Northwest which will see their populations grow by roughly 10 percent according to one model. Once-chilly places like Minnesota and Michigan and Vermont will become more temperate verdant and inviting. Vast regions will prosper; just as Hsiang’s research forecast that Southern counties could see a tenth of their economy dry up he projects that others as far as North Dakota and Minnesota will enjoy a corresponding expansion. Cities like Detroit Rochester Buffalo and Milwaukee will see a renaissance with their excess capacity in infrastructure water supplies and highways once again put to good use. One day it’s possible that a high-speed rail line could race across the Dakotas through Idaho’s up-and-coming wine country and the country’s new breadbasket along the Canadian border to the megalopolis of Seattle which by then has nearly merged with Vancouver to its north. Sitting in my own backyard one afternoon this summer my wife and I talked through the implications of this looming American future. The facts were clear and increasingly foreboding. Yet there were so many intangibles — a love of nature the busy pace of life the high cost of moving — that conspired to keep us from leaving. Nobody wants to migrate away from home even when an inexorable danger is inching ever closer. They do it when there is no longer any other choice. <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/magazine/20mag-Climate2-Images-10/20mag-Climate2-Images-10-master1050-v2.jpg"> SONOMA COUNTY CALIF.

‘Nothing to Do With Climate Change’: Conservative Media and Trump Align on Fires,headline,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/business/media/wildfires-conservative-media.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509
Rush Limbaugh told millions of his radio listeners to set aside any suggestion that climate change was the culprit for the frightening spate of wildfires ravaging California and the Pacific Northwest.“Man-made global warming is not a scientific certainty; it cannot be proven nor has it ever been” Mr. Limbaugh declared on his Friday show disregarding the mountains of empirical evidence to the contrary. He then pivoted to a popular right-wing talking point: that policies meant to curtail climate change are in fact an assault on freedom.“Environmentalist wackos” — Mr. Limbaugh’s phrase — “want man to be responsible for it because they want to control your behavior” the conservative host said on the show. He added that they “want to convince you that your lifestyle choices are the reason why all these fires are firing up out on the Left Coast.”Hours later that message leapt to prime time on Fox News where the host Tucker Carlson said those who blamed climate change for the fires were merely reciting “a partisan talking point.”“In the hands of Democratic politicians climate change is like systemic racism in the sky” Mr. Carlson told viewers. “You can’t see it but rest assured it’s everywhere and it’s deadly. And like systemic racism it is your fault.”Mr. Limbaugh and Mr. Carlson are two of the most prominent commentators in the right-wing media sphere where a rich history of climate denialism has merged with Trump-era cultural warfare to generate a deep skepticism of the notion that climate change is a factor in the fires devastating the West Coast.Like President Trump conservative media stars dismiss climate change — which scientists say is the primary cause of the conflagration — and point to the poor management of forestland by local (and conveniently Democratic) officials. Fringe right-wing websites like The Gateway Pundit have blamed left-wing arsonists fueling false rumors that authorities say are impeding rescue efforts.Visiting California on Monday to witness the destruction firsthand Mr. Trump took Western states to task for failing to manage the forests properly. During a meeting with California officials who pushed him to acknowledge the role of climate change in the wildfires the president said: “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch.”“I wish science agreed with you” Wade Crowfoot California’s secretary for natural resources replied.“Well I don’t think science knows actually” Mr. Trump retorted.The president’s comments were likely to resonate with fans of the conservative media personalities who routinely defend his agenda.“This has nothing to do with climate change it has nothing to do with man-made climate change and it sure as hell would help if these forests in these timber areas were free to be properly managed but they’re not” Mark Levin another popular right-wing radio host said on his nationally syndicated show on Friday.Like Mr. Carlson Mr. Levin drew a link between climate advocacy and recent demonstrations for racial justice suggesting that both causes — widely associated with liberals — offered a cloak for more sinister intentions.“They want to talk man-made climate change because out of this they want to control you” Mr. Levin said. “It’s just like the race stuff — ‘systemically racist’ — well what do you want to do about it? Control you. Beat you down. You need to change your lifestyle need to confess to something.”Some right-wing writers see even darker origins in the outbreak of a lethal blaze.The Gateway Pundit a conspiracy website with a healthy online following — its chief writer Jim Hoft was welcomed to the White House by Mr. Trump — published posts asserting that left-wing anarchists were to blame not the environment.“Many arsonists have already been arrested in Oregon Washington and California but the Democrats continue to blame the wildfires on climate change” a Gateway Pundit story said on Monday alongside a video purportedly showing a woman in Oregon confronting an arsonist on her property. The site claimed that mainstream news outlets were ignoring this story because “it goes against their global warming and anti-gun narrative.”A man in Oregon was charged last week with starting the destructive Almeda Fire in a small town that was under orders to evacuate. But the authorities say rising temperatures are a predominant cause of this year’s outbreak.Updated Sept. 15 2020 9:15 p.m. ETFor the president’s political supporters the notion that rogue firestarters are causing havoc is an enticing echo of a key message adopted by Mr. Trump and Republican in the presidential race: that regions of the country have been consumed by left-wing violence.And Mr. Trump continues to play down environmental factors. Asked on Tuesday’s “Fox & Friends” about his policy plans for fighting climate change the president replied: “You have forests all over the world. You don’t have fires like you do in California.”Californians have been debating how to reduce the risk of deadly blazes with some officials arguing for more controlled burns. An August news release from the office of Gavin Newsom the California governor noted that the state’s forests were “highly vulnerable to catastrophic wildfire and in need of active science-based management” in part because of hotter and drier conditions created by climate change.Mr. Newsom has called for the federal government to play a more active role in managing the state’s forests. About 58 percent of California forestland is controlled by the federal government; the state owns 3 percent.For environmental advocacy groups problematic media coverage of the wildfires is not limited to platforms associated with the right.The Environmental Defense Fund in a scathing post said many mainstream news outlets had failed to draw a direct link between the widespread destruction and the dangerous consequences of a changing climate.“It is like talking about the increased spread of Covid while ignoring the reason it is spreading” the group wrote.,body,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/business/media/wildfires-conservative-media.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509
A Pastor, a School Bus and a Trip Through a Scorched Oregon Town,headline,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/fires-phoenix-oregon.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509
PHOENIX Ore. — In a season that has seen fast-moving fires lay waste to millions of acres along the West Coast perhaps no town has seen the destructive fury that leveled parts of Phoenix Ore.In the span of a few hours on Sept. 8 the Almeda Fire burned through large parts of not only Phoenix but the neighboring town of Talent together home to 11000 people. Local officials estimated that the fire destroyed nearly 1800 homes and businesses.The ruin was so widespread that a week later the authorities still would not allow residents to return home to see what was left. For days many of the displaced were forced to scrutinize bits of aerial footage for clues while others hiked for miles to get around roadblocks.Four days after the fire a New York Times reporter stood in a Home Depot parking lot on the outskirts of town trying to find a way in. The National Guard had blocked the main entry points and the police were patrolling the streets for people who had sneaked in worried about the danger of downed power lines and sinkholes.And then a yellow school bus pulled up.Behind the wheel was a burly grandfather in sunglasses and an orange reflective vest. He introduced himself as Lee Gregory 63 a local pastor and school bus driver originally from of all places Paradise Calif. the site of California’s deadliest fire. After creating a charity for his hometown when it burned in 2018 he now faced disaster in his new home. Within a day he restarted the charity and threw himself into another relief effort.“If you want to take a bus ride you’re invited” he said. “I can take you there. No one else can.”The bus rumbled down Highway 99 the main thoroughfare in Phoenix and Talent that had now become a path through the wreckage.Riding along was another passenger whom Mr. Gregory had picked up two days earlier in the same Home Depot parking lot: Stuart Warren a 35-year-old Phoenix councilman who had been looking for ways to help constituents. The duo had since been carrying perishable food from powerless supermarkets and displaced families to evacuation shelters.Mr. Warren did not seem like your average politician. He was a bearded fly-fishing guide with a duck-call ringtone who had moved to Phoenix in 2015 because he could not afford a house in his hometown Ashland Ore.For decades the town has been an affordable haven from the nearby cities of Medford and Ashland offering cheap housing an idyllic Pacific Northwest setting and access to medical care and jobs minutes up the freeway. That mix has attracted retirees on fixed incomes and farm workers who pick the sweet Comice pears from nearby orchards that end up in Harry & David gift baskets shipped around the world.The Almeda Fire disproportionately hit those residents wiping out about a dozen tightly packed mobile-home parks. Local officials and residents said that many homeowners in those parks lacked insurance in part because fire did not seem to be a threat; they could hear the freeway from their bedrooms. And none of them owned even a slice of land; they rented the small plots where their homes once sat.With such a financial blow many of those people will struggle to return and some said last week that they did not want to. For local leaders it raises the question: Can Phoenix ever fully recover? And if it does will it have a place for the people who once called it home?“When this starts getting cleaned up big money will come here and invest just like they did in Paradise” Mr. Gregory said. “These towns won’t be back the way they were.”Mr. Gregory steered the bus past the Harry & David headquarters and toward the police checkpoint that marked the start of the burn zone. He smiled and waved and a police officer waved the bus through.Quickly the earth was black on both sides. The bus passed pile after pile of rubble some still with signs telling of what was once there. There was D & S Harley-Davidson a motorcycle shop; the Rogue Action Center housing a nonprofit group working on climate change; and Umpqua Bank where the only thing left standing was the vault. “It gets worse every time” Mr. Warren said.Mr. Gregory began to slow down. A woman was walking alongside the road in an area where she was not supposed to be. He tooted the horn stopped and swung open the doors. “Ma’am” he said. “Do you need a ride somewhere?”She had been hiking back to the Home Depot. She climbed aboard and Mr. Warren and the reporter hopped off.Not far from where the bus stopped a neon sign announced Royal Oaks Mobil Manor a 55-and-older mobile-home park that was now a sea of cinders.Sandra Nickerson 78 a retired long-haul trucker who had lived there got on the phone from the evacuation center where she was staying to try to direct a Times reporter to her home. She held out hope that it was still there. Continue down the middle road she said “and take a left at the purple house.” Her house number was 61.There was no house no numbers and no purple. Everything was gray. “Well OK” she said.Ms. Nickerson was a Phoenix lifer. She had attended the same brick schoolhouse as her mother. She recalled the Fourth of July parade fishing on the Rogue River and hot cakes and ham at the Phoenix truck stop. She had raised her family in Phoenix while her husband drove a bus for Harry & David shuttling farm workers to the pear orchards. She had planned to die there.“I’d stay right there in Phoenix if there was a place to live” she said. “But there isn’t.” On Monday her son picked her up from the evacuation center and took her north to Portland Ore.At her mobile-home park each plot was a pile of ash with a few identifiable items. Metal chair frames. A barbecue smoker. Hubcaps. A satellite dish. A melted patio chair floated in the pool. It was silent other than the distant din of the freeway and the chirping of birds perched on charred branches overhead.Updated Sept. 15 2020 9:15 p.m. ETMr. Warren looked weary. “Trying to describe the destruction really the only words I can come up with are absolute” he said. “These folks’ homes. I mean they want to come back to sift through their stuff. But there’s nothing to sift through.”As for himself “I’m tired. Really tired. But you know any time I take a break my sadness gets worse” he said his voice breaking.The mobile-home park next to Royal Oaks was largely full of immigrant farmworkers and their families and it also burned. Before Tuesday that park was home to David Pacheco Ramona Curiel de Pacheco and their two sons. Now it was gone.The couple both Mexican immigrants had built a life in Phoenix. Ms. Curiel de Pacheco 48 baked cookies and cakes for Harry & David. Mr. Pacheco who is disabled helped care for their children. Eight years ago they bought a mobile home in Phoenix. “We lived at ease there” Ms. Curiel de Pacheco said in Spanish.But they had no insurance and almost no savings. When asked how they were holding up Ms. Curiel de Pacheco began to cry. “How do you think we feel?” she said. “Everything of ours burned. We couldn’t even get our children’s papers.”She said she had no sense of where to go next but she was clear about one thing: “I don’t want to live in Phoenix.”Back on the bus the road began to narrow and Highway 99 became Main Street. Mr. Gregory slowed to a stop in front of four brick walls. It was Barkley’s Tavern long the town’s lone bar built in 1898.“I was the bar chaplain” Mr. Gregory said getting out to peer in at the charred remains. “Like most taverns a place where people found a lot of fellowship and friendship.”Faint heat still radiated from the heap. Still identifiable was the kitchen where they made the broasted chicken that Mr. Gregory loved and the slot machines which he did not.The group kept walking past the barbershop the Judo academy and Puck’s Donuts — all destroyed. Next was the adjacent town of Talent and a clearing that overlooked a hollowed-out subdivision. Mr. Gregory pulled over.Everyone looked in somber silence for a moment. Below two people rummaged by a hole where a home used to be.Daniel Verner was searching for the box that held the ashes of his wife. She had died of cancer 11 months earlier a tragedy that led him to leave Ashland for a new home in Talent. Now his wife’s Honda Accord was melted to the pavement out front and he could not find her ashes.Mr. Verner 74 is a painter and musician specializing in portraits and traditional folk music from around the world. He plays 15 instruments and was angry with himself for grabbing only two when the police told him to flee. “I got my Greek bouzouki and my Irish bouzouki but I didn’t get my Russian balalaika or my Turkish oud” he said.He was shaken up by the scene. “There’s still some part of my psyche that just goes into not believing” he said. “I wish I would have grabbed some more. A few more.”He was with Cherie Grubbs 64 a retired nurse and his next-door neighbor. She was searching the rubble for mementos of her son who was murdered in 2011 such as his guitar or Mother’s Day cards. Instead she salvaged a lantern that her father had used as a signaler for the railroad but not much else.Mr. Verner cut his hand on the rubble and they decided to go to the hospital for a tetanus shot. They had hiked in a mile so Mr. Gregory agreed that they needed a lift. While walking Mr. Verner and Ms. Grubbs said they were in a relationship forged by heartache.“We kind of shared this incredible unbearable grief” she said. “We kind of thought we paid our grief dues.”The school bus rounded the corner and everyone climbed on.The next morning Mr. Gregory delivered his first sermon since the fire had left 10 of his parishioners homeless.Nearly 50 people gathered on the cushioned seats few with masks. A five-piece band was on the stage with Mr. Gregory’s wife Doreen on keyboard. Mr. Gregory paced on the carpet below wearing the same orange bus-driver vest over his shirt and tie.“We are going to cry out to God for help” he said.The band began to play and the room rose and sang: “We’ve been through fire. We’ve been through rain. We’ve been refined by the power of his name.”Mr. Gregory stood in front of his congregation again. “I want to take you on a journey” he said as aerial footage of Phoenix’s destruction began to play on a screen. “The Bible teaches you: You don’t always get to plan your journeys.”,body,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/fires-phoenix-oregon.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509
Hurricane Sally Is a Slow-Moving Threat. Climate Change Might Be Why.,headline,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/hurricane-sally.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509
In the oyster and fishing town of Bayou La Batre how Mr. Nelson found himself under a house and how the house got built in the first place was tangled in the long painful drama of a changing climate that has irrevocably complicated life along the Gulf Coast.Mr. Nelson 66 had been living more than 300 miles west of Bayou La Batre in the small Louisiana town of Hackberry. But a few weeks ago Hurricane Laura roared out of the Gulf and devastated Hackberry including Mr. Nelson’s home a little travel trailer right on the water.“You’re looking at the last person to get out of Hackberry” said Mr. Nelson who made his escape just before Laura’s landfall when his sister Stephenie Bosarge 63 picked him up and brought him to her elevated home just off the water on the Alabama shore.A different house had been on the property before Hurricane Katrina blew it away in 2005 along with Ms. Bosarge’s wedding bands family photos and oyster shop. The Volunteers of America came through town and built her this new raised house a few blocks from the water.Since Katrina many houses in Bayou La Batre are now jacked up on stilts and people have their ways of figuring out what to do with all that space below parking a truck or boat stashing junk or storing tools. At her house Ms. Bosarge installed a tiki bar some porch swings and a stereo system.Soon they planned on evacuating riding out the storm with a relative on higher ground in Grand Bay. But for the time being the siblings sat on their porch swings watching this new slow-moving disaster unfold around them wondering how high the water would rise and joking about Mr. Nelson’s bad fortune.But they were serious about what had happened to their way of life and the life of so many other Gulf people. “It is coming to an end” Ms. Bosarge said. “Baby I knew that years ago.”Richard Fausset reported from Bayou La Batre Rick Rojas from Atlanta and Henry Fountain from Albuquerque.

The authorities say they have few reports of criminal activity associated with the fires but that has done little to alleviate panic in rural communities largely focused on nearby Portland Ore. which has had downtown protests for months. In Clackamas County a rural stretch of farms and mountains south of Portland that have been ravaged by the Riverside Fire the authorities say that calls to 911 increased 400 percent over their normal volume.“The majority of those calls are actually unfounded” Sheriff Craig Roberts of Clackamas County said in a news conference on Monday. He said many of the people going into communities were not looters but residents or neighbors offering help. But his officers have encountered armed citizens stopping people at gunpoint in an attempt to protect communities from looting he said does not exist.“Please stop that” he said. “Call us let us handle it. It’s illegal to stop someone at gunpoint and many of the people we have seen going into these areas are actually going in to get another load of their personal belongings.”Alissa Azar a freelance journalist was taking pictures along the roadside as fire bore down on the tiny town of Molalla in a farming region an hour’s drive south of Portland. She got down on one knee to snap a photo of a fire danger sign she said and when she looked up three men were pointing assault rifles at her.“They were very hostile very aggressive demanding to know what I was doing” she said. Ms. Azar said the men berated her and two other journalists as they tried to work. “I’ve been covering the protests since they started but I didn’t expect to find any kind of confrontation covering the fire” she said. Law enforcement has also had to combat unsubstantiated rumors that the fires themselves are the result of left-wing extremists.

I actually in many ways I up played it terms of action” Mr. Trump said in response to a question about his consequential conversation with the journalist earlier this year.That claim represented a direct contradiction to what he said in a recording to Mr. Woodward after he had been told that the virus posed grave national security threat to the country.“I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down because I don’t want to create a panic” Mr. Trump told Woodward on March 19 in excerpts of audio interviews obtained by CNN.The president said he had done “a great job” on the pandemic and claimed without offering proof that the death toll could have been as high as two million if he had not imposed travel bans against China and Europe in February and March.As of Tuesday more than 195000 Americans have died from the virus.When George Stephanopoulos the ABC News chief anchor pressed him to prove his assertion the president responded “We did a very very good job when we put that ban on.”The first question came from a Pennsylvania voter who asked him why he threw him “under the bus” by not responding quickly to the pandemic.Mr. Trump as he has done consistently repeated several unsupported claims about his administration’s response to the virus and claimed that a vaccine could be ready in “several weeks” despite warnings by federal officials that it will take much longer.His responses to questions about the use of masks were confusing. Despite near unanimity in the scientific community that masks stem the spread of the virus Mr. Trump claimed that there were “some” people who think using masks is still a bad idea.When a voter asked him why he did not wear a face covering during most of his public events Mr. Trump deflected by telling a story about his recent experiences eating out in a restaurant.“Waiters come over and they serve with a mask and they are playing with a mask and they are touching and then they are touching the plate — that can’t be good” he said.The 90-minute pretaped town hall event is one of the first events Mr. Trump has held in front of a group of voters who were not already supporting him — coming two weeks before the first of his trio of debates against the Democratic nominee former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Protesters took to the streets in cities like New York and Berlin after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.Credit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesPresident Trump refused on Tuesday to acknowledge any race problem in America when asked by an undecided Black voter at an ABC News town hall event to explain how the slogan “Make America Great Again” would have any resonance with African Americans and to address systemic racism in the country.“I hope there’s not a race problem” Mr. Trump said when the audience member a young Black man who voted for Jill Stein of the Green Party in 2016 noted the president had yet to address racism in America. “There’s none with me. I have great respect for all races for everybody. This country is great because of it.”In his response Mr. Trump made no mention of the anger and fear that have driven protesters across the country to speak out after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in May. Instead he simply claimed that the economy before the coronavirus hit was boosting Black Americans.“There was going to be unity” he said. “Unfortunately that was hurt because we got set back.”Mr. Trump said income inequality was a problem but claimed “I can only compare it to the past. The African-American the Black community was doing better than it had ever done by far.”“There was a gap” in wages between white and Black Americans he acknowledged “but we were doing a good job.”Mr. Trump also pivoted to a defense of the police when asked about the problem of police brutality and how it overwhelmingly affects minority communities.“You also have bad apples” he said. “You have 99 percent great people. You have to give the respect back to the police that they deserve.”When Mr. Stephanopoulous pressed that the statistics — Black Americans are three times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police — showed that there was more at play than “bad apples” Mr. Trump doubled down.“I can only say this that he police in this country have done generally a great job” he said. “There are crimes there are problems and there are chokers. They choke under pressure. I mean they have one quarter of a second to make a decision and sometimes they make a wrong decision and that’s a terrible thing.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBiden visits Florida and unveils a plan to help Puerto Rico.VideoBacktranscript‘We Owe Them’ Biden Says Of VeteransLess than 1 percent of the population of our country chooses to serve our country in the military. Less than 1 percent risk everything to defend our nation our values and everything we hold dear. And the other 99 percent of us we owe them — we owe them our thanks our gratitude and our respect. In my view based on reports and interviews President Trump has proven he’s unfit to hold the office of the presidency time and again but nowhere are his faults more glaring and more offensive to me at least then when it comes to his denigration of our servicemembers — veterans wounded warriors the fallen. Quite frankly — I won’t say — quite frankly it makes me very upset the way he gets in front of a camera and crows about how much he has done for veterans and then turns around and insults our servicemembers and fallen heroes when the camera’s off. Calls them “suckers” and “losers.” But we can do so much better than we’re doing now. We have an obligation to do so much better. We have to help our heroes understand that it’s an honorable thing to do and take strength to reach out and ask for help if they’re suffering from unseen wounds. They’re so accustomed to being asked not to ask for anything. We have to end the stigma surrounding mental health treatment.The Democratic presidential nominee Joseph R. Biden Jr. gave an impassioned speech contrasting his experience interacting with veterans to President Trump’s.CreditCredit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesJoseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday made his first trip to Florida as the Democratic presidential nominee facing a tight race in the state and a challenge consolidating support among its Latino voters that he moved to address as he campaigned along the increasingly Democratic I-4 corridor.Against a backdrop of polls that showed Mr. Biden both cutting into traditional Republican constituencies and sometimes underperforming Hillary Clinton’s 2016 showing with Latino voters in Florida he sought to engage a broad range of voters with stops in Tampa and then in Kissimmee for a Hispanic Heritage Month event.Mr. Biden’s campaign on Tuesday also unveiled a plan aimed at supporting Puerto Rico which comes as he has faced urgent calls from some allies to shore up his standing with Puerto Rican voters a critical constituency in Florida.The plan goes beyond the issue of Puerto Rican statehood though Mr. Biden addressed the subject in his remarks on Tuesday.“I happen to believe statehood would be the most effective means of ensuring that residents of Puerto Rico are treated equally with equal representation at a federal level” he said. “But the people of Puerto Rico must decide and the United States federal government must respect and act on that decision.”The plan also called for accelerated disaster reconstruction funding investments in Puerto Rican infrastructure following devastating hurricanes and efforts to “reduce its unsustainable debt burden” among other proposals.Other event participants included the actress Eva Longoria and the singers Ricky Martin and Luis Fonsi who speaking from behind socially distanced lecterns urged viewers to vote and noted President Trump’s record of what critics have seen as callous comments and actions toward Puerto Rico.“Donald Trump doesn’t seem to grasp doesn’t seem to grasp that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens already” Mr. Biden said. Jabbing at the president he continued “I’m not going to throw paper towels at people whose lives have just been devastated by a hurricane.”He started the trip earlier Tuesday with a veterans-focused event at a community college in Tampa.There Mr. Biden laced into Mr. Trump over a report by The Atlantic that Mr. Trump had referred to American soldiers killed in combat during World War I as “losers” and “suckers” and had repeatedly been dismissive of military service at other points in his presidency. Mr. Trump has denied The Atlantic report.“Nowhere are his faults more glaring and more offensive to me at least than when it comes to his denigration of our servicemembers veterans wounded warriors” Mr. Biden said.Mr. Biden spoke in often-personal terms about the challenges facing military families and veterans including mental health and child care concerns. Mr. Biden whose late son Beau Biden deployed to Iraq with the Delaware Army National Guard also suggested that Mr. Trump pays lip service at best to veterans.“Our military is the greatest fighting force in the history of the world and that’s not hyperbole” he said. It “deserves a commander-in-chief who respects their sacrifice understands their service and will never betray the values they defend.”He went on to host a round-table discussion with veterans that touched on a wide range of issues including Social Security health care systemic racism and racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19 and the environment.“I can guarantee you if I’m president there will be no offshore drilling” he said calling for “basically a permanent moratorium” on the practice in Florida.Senator Chris Coons of Delaware who defeated Jessica Scarane on Tuesday during an oversight hearing in Washington D.C.Credit...Pool photo by Toni Sandys Delaware Democrats renominated Senator Chris Coons a 10-year-incumbent for a second full term. Mr. Coons turned back Jessica Scarane a progressive challenger who never attracted the kind of financing or enthusiasm that propelled other left-wing candidates to defeat centrist Democratic congressional incumbents this year.Ms. Scarane had hoped to tap into the enthusiasm that launched progressive challengers to victories over veteran Democratic congressmen in Chicago St. Louis and the Bronx. But Delaware’s 2020 Senate race never became a cause célèbre on the left.A poll conducted last month by a confederation of progressive organizations considering investing in the race on Ms. Scarane’s behalf found Mr. Coons leading by 40 percentage points a margin sufficient to dissuade them from spending money to help Ms. Scarane.Mr. Coons still took the race seriously and used an enormous fund-raising advantage to blanket Delawareans with television ads spending nearly $800000 compared with Ms. Scarane’s $65000. The only third-party organization to devote significant resources to the race was the American Chemistry Council which aired more than $200000 in ads backing Mr. Coons.Ms. Scarane who moved to Delaware from New York 10 years ago did not have the profile of other left-wing upstarts who have toppled incumbent centrist Democrats. Progressive organizations had first sought to recruit a woman of color to support in the race. Kerri Evelyn Harris a Black progressive organizer gave Delaware’s other Democratic senator Tom Carper a brief scare in 2018 before Mr. Carper prevailed by nearly 30 percentage points.Trump blames Biden who does not hold any office for not instituting a national mask mandate.Flags flew at half staff around the Washington Monument in May in memory of those who died from the coronavirus. There are now 195000 deaths in the United States.Credit...Anna Moneymaker/The New York TimesPresident Trump on Tuesday night struck a defensive tone when pressed on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic at one point mounting a bizarre argument that his Democratic rival former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. failed to institute a national mask mandate even though he currently holds no government position from which to do so.“They said at the Democrat convention they’re going to do a national mandate” Mr. Trump said “They never did it because they’ve checked out and they didn’t do it. And a good question is you ask why Joe Biden — they said we’re going to do a national mandate on masks.”White House officials have questioned whether a national mask mandate would be legal and it’s not clear what courts would say about the legality of one. But Mr. Trump appeared to blame his Democratic rival for not instituting a policy he said he would support if elected.It was part of an overall unrepentant stance the president assumed when pressed by regular voters with simple questions about how he and his administration have responded to the pandemic. Mr. Trump did not lose his temper but the forum appeared to be uncomfortable for him: the president typically castigates reporters who ask him questions he does not like or simply speaks in front of adoring crowds who don’t challenge him at all. Here he had no obvious foil to spar with.When an undecided voter who cast her vote four years ago for Hillary Clinton asked a simple question “why don’t you wear a mask more often?” Mr. Trump who has only been photographed while wearing a mask a few times claimed that he did. “I do wear them when I have to and when I’m in hospitals and other locations.”When asked why he played down the virus in public despite telling the journalist Bob Woodward that he knew how deadly it was he claimed “in many ways I up-played it in terms of action. My action was very strong.”When pressed on the death toll — the country is dealing with 195000 deaths because of the coronavirus which is still claiming hundreds of lives a day — Mr. Trump said he would not have done anything differently and that the stunning number did not give him pause. “I think we could have had two million deaths if we didn’t close out the country” he said.When asked by a voter who supported him in 2016 if he would modulate his tone if he was re-elected Mr. Trump said it was unlikely. “Sometimes you don’t have time to be presidential” he said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyPeople showed their support for Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris in Miami this weekend.Credit...Maria Alejandra Cardona for The New York TimesAs Joseph R. Biden Jr. traveled to Florida a new poll was released offering him signs of hope there in one of the most competitive states in this year’s presidential election.Mr. Biden the Democratic presidential nominee held a wide lead over President Trump among Latino voters according to the poll which was conducted by Monmouth University and he had the upper hand in the most politically competitive areas of the state.Mr. Biden had the support of 50 percent of registered voters while Mr. Trump attracted the support of 45 percent. That difference was within the poll’s margin of error.Monmouth ran two likely voter projections one accounting for high levels of voter participation and another for a lower-turnout scenario. When turnout was high Mr. Biden’s edge remained at five percentage points but with voter participation lower it ticked down to three points.The Monmouth poll also showed Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump 58 percent to 32 percent among Latino voters who are widely seen as crucial to a Democratic victory in Florida.The results were more auspicious for Mr. Biden than those of two other quality polls released this month which had showed him and Mr. Trump roughly splitting the Hispanic vote in Florida. Those polls were a cause for concern among Democrats as Hillary Clinton won among Florida’s Latino voters by 27 points in 2016 according to exit polls.Mr. Trump won Florida that year but only by 1.2 percentage points.The Monmouth survey showed Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump neck-and-neck among voters 65 and older reflecting the president’s weakened support among one of the state’s most crucial voting demographics. In 2016 exit polls showed him winning that demographic by 17 points. The Monmouth poll found that 49 percent of older voters supported Mr. Trump while 47 percent backed Mr. Biden.Mr. Biden was ahead by a nearly 2-to-1 margin in the seven counties spread across the state that were decided by under 10 points in the 2016 election suggesting that Mr. Trump’s path to victory in Florida primarily involves turning out his base rather than winning over persuadable voters.The Monmouth poll which was conducted from Sept. 10-13 had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.Senator Kamala Harris and Gov. Gavin Newsom both of California assess the damage from the Creek Fire at Pine Ridge Elementary in Auberry Calif.Credit...Gary Kazanjian/Associated PressSenator Kamala Harris the Democratic vice-presidential nominee traveled to California on Tuesday to survey the destruction caused by the wildfires raging through the American West blaming the damage on climate change as she visited a heavily damaged area northeast of Fresno.In her first appearance in her home state since her nomination Ms. Harris met with Gov. Gavin Newsom a Democrat and local officials and firefighters at the Pine Ridge School in Auberry a community ravaged by what is known as the Creek fire.Ms. Harris dressed in jeans a white T-shirt and a green jacket listened as emergency officials gave an overview of the fire’s extensive damage then walked with Mr. Newsom to look at the rubble of a destroyed home. As ash fell from the sky Ms. Harris praised the firefighters and urged a serious campaign to reverse climate change.“We have to do better as a country” she said. “We have to understand that California like so many other parts of our country has experienced extreme weather conditions. It is incumbent on us in terms of the leadership of this nation to take seriously these new changes in our climate and to do what we can to mitigate against the damage.”Ms. Harris’s visit came one day after President Trump met with Mr. Newsom in Sacramento. Despite a consensus among scientists that climate change is playing a role in both the size and intensity of the fires the president blamed poor forest management.The Democratic presidential nominee former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. attacked Mr. Trump labeling him a “climate arsonist.”The Creek fire regarded as the 12th largest in modern California history has burned an estimated 332 square miles of the Sierra National Forest and destroyed nearly 600 structures in Fresno and Madera counties. More than 64000 people are under evacuation orders.Ms. Harris landed Tuesday morning at Fresno Yosemite International Airport.

Biden Jr. retweeting a post with the hashtag “PedoBiden.”The tweet originating from an account called “Conservative Girl” shows a GIF of Mr. Biden standing behind Stephanie Carter during the 2015 swearing-in ceremony of her husband the former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter.By retweeting the post Mr. Trump appeared to be taking the campaign to a new low as well as embracing a fringe theory promoted by QAnon the far-right conspiracy movement. The group has been spreading the far-fetched idea that Mr. Trump is fighting a shadowy cabal of Democratic pedophiles in Washington.In the GIF Mr. Biden appeared to squeeze Ms. Carter’s shoulder and whisper something in her ear.At the time of the incident the photo went viral with some critics suggesting that it illustrated Mr. Biden’s inappropriate behavior toward women.But Ms. Carter later wrote that not only were the Bidens close friends but also that the image was misleading and that Mr. Biden had leaned forward to tell her “thank you” on a day when she was uncharacteristically nervous so much so that she had fallen on ice at the Pentagon.Mr. Biden has faced criticism in the past for his behavior toward women with several coming forward in 2019 to allege that he had touched their shoulders or hair in a way that made them feel uncomfortable. None of the women however was a minor.It was the second time a member of the Trump family had smeared Mr. Biden with the incendiary allegation. In May Donald Trump Jr. Mr. Trump’s oldest son posted a picture of Mr. Biden on Instagram saying “See you later alligator” along with an image of an alligator saying “In a while pedophile.” The inflammatory claim was shared with 2.8 million of the younger Mr. Trump’s Instagram followers.The younger Mr. Trump one of his father’s most frequent surrogates on the campaign trail later said he was “joking around” echoing one of his father’s tactics.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySarah McBride was the first openly transgender person to work at the White House when she was an intern during President Barack Obama’s administration.Credit...Jason Minto/Associated PressDelaware Democrats on Tuesday nominated Sarah McBride a longtime transgender activist for a State Senate seat advancing her bid to become the nation’s highest-ranking openly transgender elected official.Ms. McBride 30 defeated a token primary challenger and is widely expected to win the November general election — the Wilmington-based seat is safely Democratic and is being vacated by Harris B. McDowell III who is retiring after representing the district for 44 years.Ms. McBride said in an interview that she wanted her victory to inspire others. “My hope is that this result can help reinforce for a young kid trying to find their place in this world here in Delaware or anywhere else in this country that this democracy is big enough for them too” she said.Ms. McBride is no newcomer to national or local politics. In 2012 she became the first openly transgender person to work at the White House when she was an intern during President Barack Obama’s administration. She later lobbied the Delaware state legislature on behalf of a transgender rights bill which was signed into law in 2013 and is now a national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign the nation’s largest L.G.B.T.Q. civil rights group.In 2016 she became the first transgender person to speak at a major party’s national convention when she took the stage before Democrats in Philadelphia.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — a towering figure in Delaware politics and now the Democratic presidential nominee — wrote the foreword to Ms. McBride’s 2018 book about her fight for transgender equality.Battles over transgender rights have played out in state legislatures across the country with conservative lawmakers in more than two dozen states introducing anti-transgender measures this year.No openly transgender person has been elected to any state’s senate though four transgender lawmakers currently serve in lower chambers of state legislatures. Like those politicians Ms. McBride said she had not focused on her identity while campaigning. “My identity and the symbolic ramifications of my elections that doesn’t come up” in conversations with voters she said. “What comes up is that we need creative and courageous leadership that will meet this moment with meaningful action for people’s lives.”Voting By MailMail ballots were processed in Butler Pa. in May.Credit...Keith Srakocic/Associated PressCounty elections officials in Pennsylvania may no longer discard mail ballots simply because they question the authenticity of a voter’s signature.The Pennsylvania Department of State issued that guidance last week and on Tuesday two organizations that had sued the state over the practice dropped a federal lawsuit challenging it.“As a result of this case Pennsylvania voters can cast their vote without fear that their ballot could be rejected solely because an election official — who isn’t trained in handwriting analysis — thinks their signatures don’t match” said Mark Gaber the director of trial litigation at the Campaign Legal Center which represented the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh and the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania in the lawsuit.With the dramatic expansion of mail voting in Pennsylvania this year the two organizations had filed suit in August arguing that local Boards of Elections in Pennsylvania had made subjective decisions on which ballots to discard.Research has shown that a variety of factors — including age and disability — cause signatures to change over time.Election workers processed absentee ballots for Michigan’s state primary in Detroit last month.Credit...Elaine Cromie for The New York TimesIn preparation for a record number of absentee ballots Michigan lawmakers moved closer on Tuesday to allowing some local clerks to start processing those ballots before Election Day.The State Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill that would permit clerks in communities with 25000 or more residents to begin processing absentee ballots for 10 hours on Nov. 2.The legislation which still has to be approved by the Michigan House of Representatives is meant to address the concerns of local clerks who have been pleading with state lawmakers for changes that would help them count what is expected to be a record number of people voting by absentee ballot.So far this year 2.1 million voters in Michigan have asked for absentee ballots for November’s election.Under the Senate bill which was approved by 34 votes to 2 clerks will only be allowed to open an envelope that holds a voter’s ballot in a secrecy sleeve. They will not be able to remove a ballot from the sleeve or begin counting it.Local clerks said the move was a good first step but they were hoping for a week of pre-processing time.In a letter to Republican legislative leaders 17 local and county clerks said the extra days “would give overwhelmed jurisdictions the ability to conduct the election in the most safe and secure manner possible.”Though Michigan allows any voter to apply for an absentee ballot the change approved on Tuesday would only be applicable for this year’s election — a provision that helped the bill pass the Republican-led Senate.“We’re in extraordinary circumstances and therefore we’re going to make exceptions to regular practices” said Amber McCann a spokeswoman for Senator Mike Shirkey the majority leader. “We’ll see if those measures are necessary for times like these.”The state’s House of Representatives also led by Republicans has previously passed other bills to make it easier for clerks to deal with absentee voting. It is expected to pass this latest measure after a hearing on the bill next week.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMichael Caputo left in 2018 after being interviewed by Senate Intelligence Committee staff members investigating Russian election meddling.Credit...J.

Then on Monday The Times reported that a Facebook video posted by Mr. Caputo the previous night was filled with bizarre and incendiary comments. He had attacked C.D.C. scientists as anti-Trumpers who had formed a “resistance unit” engaged in “rotten science” and “haven’t gotten out of their sweatpants” except for coffee shop meetings where they plotted against the president. He urged his gun-owning followers to buy ammunition because “it’s going to be hard to get” and warned without evidence that left-wing hit squads across the nation were training for violent attacks.

Biden Jr. over President Trump.The survey known as the 2020 Asian American Voter Survey found that 54 percent of respondents planned to vote for Mr. Biden compared with only 30 percent who planned to vote for Mr. Trump and roughly 14 percent who were undecided.Roughly 44 percent of those surveyed identified as Democrats 23 percent as Republicans and about 31 percent as independents or another party.Though they make up only about 5 percent of the nation’s voters Asian-Americans are the fasting growing racial group in the country and experts say their influence is growing in presidential swing states like Nevada North Carolina Georgia and others. In addition large concentrations of Asian-American voters in states like California and Texas could factor significantly into tight Congressional races there.After Asian-American voters broke turnout records in the 2018 midterm elections experts have for months been predicting that the 2020 general election could see even more of them going to the polls.“Through this survey we see that Asian-Americans are ready to exercise their power” said John C. Yang the head of Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC an advocacy group that co-sponsored the survey.The data released Tuesday was drawn from a survey of 1569 Asian-American registered voters that was conducted from July 4 to Sept. 10.Roughly 54 percent of the respondents said that they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting in the fall. Mr. Biden was favored among all Asian-American national origin groups surveyed except for Vietnamese-Americans who preferred Mr. Trump to Mr. Biden 48 percent to 36 percent.Indian-Americans were the group most supportive of Mr. Biden with two in three saying they planned to vote for the former vice president.Majorities of the Asian-Americans surveyed also said they would support Democratic candidates over Republican ones in House and Senate races.World opinion of the U.S. and Trump is in a tailspin as the pandemic persists a Pew poll finds.Under President Trump international regard for the U.S. has steadily fallen a survey found.Credit...Anna Moneymaker for The New York TimesAmerica’s international standing under President Trump is at or near its lowest levels since the dawn of the millennium because of his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic the nonpartisan Pew Research Center reported Tuesday as it released a new poll.Pew which surveyed residents of 13 industrialized countries on four continents found that only 15 percent believe that the United States has done a good job combating the virus.In every country polled respondents gave much higher marks to their home governments the World Health Organization and China than to the U.S. despite Mr. Trump’s claims that this country is handling the crisis better than any other and his attempts to shift blame for the outbreak to the W.H.O. and Beijing.“Since Donald Trump took office as president the image of the United States has suffered across many regions of the globe” the report’s authors concluded.The country’s falling standing accelerates a downward trend that began when Mr. Trump took office in 2017 after campaigning on a platform of “America First” — foreign opinions and alliances be damned.Before the Trump era public opinion of the U.S. remained steadily north of 50 percent in most countries — with the exception of the early 2000s when President George W. Bush waged an unpopular war in Iraq. In the new survey the U.S.’s median approval rating among the 13 countries was 34 percent.Opinion of the U.S. are tethered tightly to those about its president. Mr. Trump netted a median approval rating of 16 percent with a low of 9 percent in Belgium and a high of only 25 percent in Japan.Those who did admire Mr. Trump had some demographic similarities with those who approve of him at home. “Men people with less education and those on the right of the ideological spectrum tend to have more confidence in Trump’s handling of world affairs than their counterparts” the report’s authors wrote.Pew surveyed 13273 adults from June 10 to Aug. 3 in Canada Belgium Denmark France Germany Italy the Netherlands Spain Sweden the U.K. Australia Japan and South Korea.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyPlanes and soldiers in a patriotic pro-Trump ad were stock images of Russians.The stock image used by the Trump campaign in a digital ad.Credit...ShutterstockThe three sleek American fighter jets patriotically swooping over a battlefield in a pro-Trump ad that ran around the Sept. 11 commemoration were in fact from Russia.The five soldiers marching under the planes were Russian too.

WASHINGTON — Michael R. Caputo the assistant secretary of health for public affairs apologized Tuesday morning to the health secretary Alex M. Azar II and to his staff members for a bizarre and incendiary Facebook outburst in which he accused federal government scientists working on the pandemic of “sedition” and warned of coming violence from left-wing “hit squads.”He is considering a leave of absence to address physical health problems according to a person familiar with the situation.Mr. Caputo 58 a longtime Trump loyalist told dozens of staff members in a hastily scheduled meeting that he was under stress because of questions about his physical health and threats to his safety and that of his family. He apologized for embarrassing Mr. Azar and the department.It was unclear Tuesday whether Mr. Caputo had seriously endangered his job with his soliloquy Sunday night which drew national attention. Among other statements that alarmed administration critics he accused the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of harboring a “resistance unit” dedicated to ousting President Trump urged his gun-owning followers to buy ammunition because “it’s going to be hard to get” and said his mental health “had definitely failed.”Some White House officials were unhappy about his remarks but any decision about Mr. Caputo’s future in the government was expected to rest with Mr. Trump.Asked about Mr. Caputo during a trip to Nashville Mr. Azar called him a “valued” member of the coronavirus response team. “Obviously some of those statements are concerning” he told The Tennessean but added: “I’m not going to comment on somebody’s personal social media posts.”Mr. Caputo has about 5000 friends on Facebook and at one point suggested that his followers publicly release his video presentation should anything happen to him.Senator Patty Murray of Washington the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees the Department of Health and Human Services urged Mr. Azar to fire Mr. Caputo. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the Democratic leader said Mr. Azar should resign charging he had allowed “perhaps the most important federal agency right now to become subservient to the president’s whims.”A department spokeswoman called Mr. Schumer’s comments “uninformed” and misleading and an effort to discredit “the historic work of the Trump administration” in battling the pandemic.Since he was installed at the 80000-employee department in April by the White House Mr. Caputo a media-savvy former Trump campaign aide with no background in health has worked aggressively to control the media strategy on pandemic issues. But over the weekend he was engulfed in two explosive controversies of his own making.First Politico then The New York Times and other news outlets published accounts of how Mr. Caputo and a top aide Dr. Paul Alexander had routinely worked to revise delay or even scuttle the core health bulletins of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to paint the administration’s pandemic response in a more positive light.

In emails obtained by Politico Dr. Alexander complained that the C.D.C. was “writing hit pieces on the administration” and insisted that it should be prevented from issuing weekly reports “unless I read and agree with the findings.”Mr. Caputo hailed Dr. Alexander as a “genius” in his Facebook talk. McMaster University in Canada had listed him as an assistant professor on its website but on Monday the university said that while Dr. Alexander had received his doctorate there he was not on the faculty.“He is not currently teaching and he is not paid by the university for his contract role as a part-time assistant professor” a spokeswoman Susan Emigh said.,body,http://nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/michael-caputo-coronavirus.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509
Breonna Taylor’s Family to Receive $12 Million Settlement From City of Louisville,headline,http://nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/breonna-taylor-settlement-louisville.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509
LOUISVILLE Ky. — After months of protests that turned Breonna Taylor’s name into a national slogan against police violence city officials agreed to pay her family $12 million and institute changes aimed at preventing future deaths by officers.The agreement announced Tuesday settled a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the young woman’s family. As her mother her lawyers and leading activists walked into the council chamber alongside the mayor there was a momentary show of unity after months of nightly sometimes violent demonstrations that have left Kentucky’s largest city boarded up. It comes six months after the death of Ms. Taylor a 26-year-old emergency room technician in a botched drug raid but before the state’s attorney general has said whether the officers involved in the shooting would be criminally charged — a key demand of protesters.“My administration is not waiting to move ahead with needed reforms to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again” Mayor Greg Fischer said. “When you know what the right thing to do is you do it. Why wait?”The agreement which did not require the city to acknowledge wrongdoing was sizable with her family receiving more than double the amount paid to the relatives of Eric Garner the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014. While a few similar cases resulted in larger payments — from $13 million to a whopping $38 million some of them came only after years in court battles. By contrast the Louisville agreement was reached in just months.Most of all it was unusual because of the range of changes — a dozen in all — that the embattled city agreed to adopt in an effort to quell the protests.“Based on at least 20 years of tracking these types of cases I’ve never seen something like this” said Christopher 2x a community organizer Ms. Taylor’s family turned to after her death. “The bottom line is the monetary amount combined with the reforms is unprecedented.”The policing changes would require more oversight by top commanders and make mandatory safeguards that were common practice in the department but were not followed the night of the March 13 raid. They would also put in place an early warning system to flag officers who have been accused of excessive force.Ms. Taylor died after her boyfriend said he mistook police officers for an intruder as they rammed in the door of her apartment after midnight to execute a search warrant. He fired his handgun striking an officer setting off a response in which a torrent of bullets sliced through Ms. Taylor’s apartment and two adjoining ones leaving her bleeding in her hallway.Since the young Black woman’s death the top demand of protesters who gather nightly in a downtown square has been that criminal charges be brought against the three white officers who shot into Ms. Taylor’s home. But because the officers were fired upon first legal experts say their actions may be protected under Kentucky’s statute allowing the police to use lethal force in self-defense. For that reason they say it is unlikely that a criminal inquiry being conducted by the state’s attorney general will result in charges against at least two of the officers who were standing directly in front of Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend Kenneth Walker when he opened fire first. A third officer though has been fired for shooting recklessly that night.The results of the attorney general’s investigation are expected to be released soon. If no charges are brought or if the charges are minor the settlement announced this week may be the closest Ms. Taylor’s family comes to justice.“This is a good first step” said Sam Aguiar one of the family’s lawyers. “The city obviously doesn’t have the power to bring charges which still rests in the hands of the attorney general. But what the city can do is change its police practices and it can acknowledge through a settlement that a lot of things went wrong that night.”Among the changes are a requirement that commanding officers review and give written approval for all search warrants a policy that was instituted recently in Lexington the second largest town in Kentucky and that has led to a drastic drop in the riskiest raids said Peter B. Kraska a professor at Eastern Kentucky University who is an expert on police reform.The department has also agreed to overhaul how simultaneous search warrants are conducted most likely a result of the manner in which the five warrants were obtained for Ms. Taylor’s residence and four others used as “trap houses” by her ex-boyfriend Jamarcus Glover a convicted drug dealer who had repeatedly made trips to her apartment in the months before the raid. An early warning system will be adopted to flag officers with disciplinary problems a measure that seems aimed at Detective Brett Hankison the officer who was fired. Multiple complaints of excessive use of force as well as sexual misconduct had been filed against Detective Hankison according to portions of his personnel file obtained by The Times most of them dismissed or deemed not credible.And to promote better relations between the department and the community officers will be encouraged to perform two hours of paid community service each pay period and will receive housing credits to encourage them to live in the neighborhoods they police according to a summary provided by Mr. Aguiar.Many of the changes appear aimed at addressing the specific lapses that led to Ms. Taylor’s death: It will now be mandatory for ambulances to be idling nearby when the police conduct a search. Although it was common practice to do so an ambulance was initially sent to Ms. Taylor’s residence before the raid only to be canceled and sent elsewhere in the hour before police officers beat down her door. “It’s really unique” Mr. Kraska said of the policing changes required in the agreement. “The family didn’t feel that justice would be served just by a monetary settlement. I have not seen this happen before.”The city had already enacted some substantive changes.Months ago the city passed “Breonna’s Law” which barred the use of “no knock” search warrants. That was the type of warrant issued for the search of Ms. Taylor’s apartment which allows the police to punch into homes without warning. On paper the numerous changes promised by the city appear ambitious. But one of the enduring problems of police reform is that — to date — departments around the country have not been able to create a mechanism for enforcing changes.“It absolutely will make no difference if there is not a lot of follow-up and accountability” Mr. Kraska said.Both Ms. Taylor’s mother and the activists who have played a leading role in the city’s ongoing demonstrations warned that the settlement was merely a first step. As the sound of the drums banged by protesters on the street below wafted into the city auditorium lawyers and advocates for her family took the microphone to call for an indictment of the officers involved in her shooting.“The restitution portion is one part” said Tamika Mallory a Black Lives Matter activist who was arrested here after leading a sit-in on the lawn of the Kentucky attorney general’s home. “But arresting the officers is what will make this city do right by its citizens — and not just by Breonna Taylor but by all the Breonna Taylors.”The gathering ended with activists and Ms. Taylor’s family chanting: “Arrest the cops! Arrest the cops!”Kitty Bennett contributed research.,body,http://nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/breonna-taylor-settlement-louisville.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509

(Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. Smoke from the West Coast wildfires spread across the continent.The blazes are an all but inescapable crisis around the country with at least 27 people dead in three states milky smoke clouding the skies over Michigan and smoke haze reaching as far as New York City.More than five million acres have burned in Oregon California and Washington State where the authorities are trying to adapt to a disaster with no clear end in sight under conditions deeply exacerbated by climate change. Forecasters said that regions of Northern California and Oregon sites of some of the most destructive fires would benefit from gentler winds on Tuesday.2. A second natural disaster is approaching the U.S.Hurricane Sally is slowly churning over the Gulf of Mexico and is expected to make landfall near Mobile Bay Ala. by Wednesday morning. A consequence of that slow pace — about 2 miles per hour — was torrents of heavy rainfall reaching as much as 30 inches in some areas from the Florida Panhandle to Mississippi. Above Gulf Shores Ala.Here are the latest updates and a map tracking the storm’s path.Officials in Alabama and Mississippi said Sally could also pound the coast with storm surge. Forecasters warned of “extreme life-threatening” flash floods heading into Wednesday but were far less sure about where the storm would ultimately deliver the most damage.3. Louisville Ky. will pay Breonna Taylor’s family $12 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit after she was killed in a botched police raid.In an effort to quell protests there the settlement also included a dozen reform measures the city agreed to adopt aimed at preventing future deaths by police officers. Bringing charges against the officers who killed Ms. Taylor a young Black woman could be an uphill battle legal experts say.We also took a close look at a police maneuver used against Daniel Prude a Black man in Rochester N.Y. who later died of suffocation. An officer leaned forward and used his full weight to push down on Mr. Prude’s head — after he was already shackled. In a suit filed last week Mr. Prude’s family characterized the maneuver as part of the “unlawful force” that caused him to stop breathing.5.

Subscribe: iTunes | Google Play Music | How to ListenIn his new book “Hoax: Donald Trump Fox News and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth” the CNN journalist Brian Stelter provides what our reviewer David Enrich called “a thorough and damning exploration of the incestuous relationship between Trump and his favorite channel.” Stelter talks about “Hoax” on this week’s podcast.“Fox’s influence is constant” he says. “When Trump threatened North Korea and said he had a bigger button than Kim Jong-un it was because of a Fox segment. When he grants pardons it’s because of Fox. When he attacks big technology companies it’s because of Fox. When he raged about migrant caravans it was because of Fox.” Stelter contrasts this with previous presidents who may have taken cues from the media but not in such an overwhelming way. “Barack Obama watched ESPN in the evening rather than MSNBC. George W. Bush might have watched some Fox but he wasn’t consumed by it the way that this president is. So it’s an unprecedented relationship it really is.”Reed Hastings the co-chief executive of Netflix visits the podcast to talk about his new book written with Erin Meyer “No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention.” “I think all forms of entertainment including video games and YouTube and books and television compete for people’s attentions” Hastings says. “But any one form is not going to achieve success by imitating another. So we don’t sit around and say ‘Let’s make our movies to be more like Fortnite the video game.’”Also on this week’s episode Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and MJ Franklin and John Williams talk about what people are reading.

Breonna Taylor’s Family to Receive $12 Million Settlement From City of Louisville,headline,http://nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/breonna-taylor-settlement-louisville.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509
LOUISVILLE Ky. — After months of protests that turned Breonna Taylor’s name into a national slogan against police violence city officials agreed to pay her family $12 million and institute changes aimed at preventing future deaths by officers.The agreement announced Tuesday settled a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the young woman’s family. As her mother her lawyers and leading activists walked into the council chamber alongside the mayor there was a momentary show of unity after months of nightly sometimes violent demonstrations that have left Kentucky’s largest city boarded up. It comes six months after the death of Ms. Taylor a 26-year-old emergency room technician in a botched drug raid but before the state’s attorney general has said whether the officers involved in the shooting would be criminally charged — a key demand of protesters.“My administration is not waiting to move ahead with needed reforms to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again” Mayor Greg Fischer said. “When you know what the right thing to do is you do it. Why wait?”The agreement which did not require the city to acknowledge wrongdoing was sizable with her family receiving more than double the amount paid to the relatives of Eric Garner the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014. While a few similar cases resulted in larger payments — from $13 million to a whopping $38 million some of them came only after years in court battles. By contrast the Louisville agreement was reached in just months.Most of all it was unusual because of the range of changes — a dozen in all — that the embattled city agreed to adopt in an effort to quell the protests.“Based on at least 20 years of tracking these types of cases I’ve never seen something like this” said Christopher 2x a community organizer Ms. Taylor’s family turned to after her death. “The bottom line is the monetary amount combined with the reforms is unprecedented.”The policing changes would require more oversight by top commanders and make mandatory safeguards that were common practice in the department but were not followed the night of the March 13 raid. They would also put in place an early warning system to flag officers who have been accused of excessive force.Ms. Taylor died after her boyfriend said he mistook police officers for an intruder as they rammed in the door of her apartment after midnight to execute a search warrant. He fired his handgun striking an officer setting off a response in which a torrent of bullets sliced through Ms. Taylor’s apartment and two adjoining ones leaving her bleeding in her hallway.Since the young Black woman’s death the top demand of protesters who gather nightly in a downtown square has been that criminal charges be brought against the three white officers who shot into Ms. Taylor’s home. But because the officers were fired upon first legal experts say their actions may be protected under Kentucky’s statute allowing the police to use lethal force in self-defense. For that reason they say it is unlikely that a criminal inquiry being conducted by the state’s attorney general will result in charges against at least two of the officers who were standing directly in front of Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend Kenneth Walker when he opened fire first. A third officer though has been fired for shooting recklessly that night.The results of the attorney general’s investigation are expected to be released soon. If no charges are brought or if the charges are minor the settlement announced this week may be the closest Ms. Taylor’s family comes to justice.“This is a good first step” said Sam Aguiar one of the family’s lawyers. “The city obviously doesn’t have the power to bring charges which still rests in the hands of the attorney general. But what the city can do is change its police practices and it can acknowledge through a settlement that a lot of things went wrong that night.”Among the changes are a requirement that commanding officers review and give written approval for all search warrants a policy that was instituted recently in Lexington the second largest town in Kentucky and that has led to a drastic drop in the riskiest raids said Peter B. Kraska a professor at Eastern Kentucky University who is an expert on police reform.The department has also agreed to overhaul how simultaneous search warrants are conducted most likely a result of the manner in which the five warrants were obtained for Ms. Taylor’s residence and four others used as “trap houses” by her ex-boyfriend Jamarcus Glover a convicted drug dealer who had repeatedly made trips to her apartment in the months before the raid. An early warning system will be adopted to flag officers with disciplinary problems a measure that seems aimed at Detective Brett Hankison the officer who was fired. Multiple complaints of excessive use of force as well as sexual misconduct had been filed against Detective Hankison according to portions of his personnel file obtained by The Times most of them dismissed or deemed not credible.And to promote better relations between the department and the community officers will be encouraged to perform two hours of paid community service each pay period and will receive housing credits to encourage them to live in the neighborhoods they police according to a summary provided by Mr. Aguiar.Many of the changes appear aimed at addressing the specific lapses that led to Ms. Taylor’s death: It will now be mandatory for ambulances to be idling nearby when the police conduct a search. Although it was common practice to do so an ambulance was initially sent to Ms. Taylor’s residence before the raid only to be canceled and sent elsewhere in the hour before police officers beat down her door. “It’s really unique” Mr. Kraska said of the policing changes required in the agreement. “The family didn’t feel that justice would be served just by a monetary settlement. I have not seen this happen before.”The city had already enacted some substantive changes.Months ago the city passed “Breonna’s Law” which barred the use of “no knock” search warrants. That was the type of warrant issued for the search of Ms. Taylor’s apartment which allows the police to punch into homes without warning. On paper the numerous changes promised by the city appear ambitious. But one of the enduring problems of police reform is that — to date — departments around the country have not been able to create a mechanism for enforcing changes.“It absolutely will make no difference if there is not a lot of follow-up and accountability” Mr. Kraska said.Both Ms. Taylor’s mother and the activists who have played a leading role in the city’s ongoing demonstrations warned that the settlement was merely a first step. As the sound of the drums banged by protesters on the street below wafted into the city auditorium lawyers and advocates for her family took the microphone to call for an indictment of the officers involved in her shooting.“The restitution portion is one part” said Tamika Mallory a Black Lives Matter activist who was arrested here after leading a sit-in on the lawn of the Kentucky attorney general’s home. “But arresting the officers is what will make this city do right by its citizens — and not just by Breonna Taylor but by all the Breonna Taylors.”The gathering ended with activists and Ms. Taylor’s family chanting: “Arrest the cops! Arrest the cops!”Kitty Bennett contributed research.,body,http://nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/breonna-taylor-settlement-louisville.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509

Covid-19 Live Updates: As Cases Rise, Europe Enters ‘Living-With-the-Virus Phase’,headline,http://nytimes.com/2020/09/15/world/covid-coronavirus.html,nytimes.com,1600223579509
Hundreds of Hasidic Jewish pilgrims seeking to enter Ukraine from Belarus in defiance of virus travel restrictions were stopped by border guards on Tuesday as Ukraine mobilized additional guards to bolster its forces. Ukraine closed its borders last month as cases in the country ticked up partly to halt the yearly pilgrimage to the city of Uman the site of the grave of Rabbi Nachman the founder of the Breslov branch of the Hasidic movement. The pilgrimage is timed to the Jewish New Year which begins on Friday. Israeli health officials have supported Ukraine’s decision in light of the pandemic.The pilgrims began arriving at a border crossing with Belarus on Monday afternoon according to the Ukrainian border guard service. Authorities in Belarus let the group pass and they gathered on a road in the buffer area between the two border stations.Through the night hundreds of men and boys danced and sang songs. Their luggage was piled along fields on both sides of the road. The men tried to convince the border guards to let them through to celebrate the new year the most important religious holiday for Hasidim. Little boys looking bored and sleepy stood by watching.Some of the pilgrims had traveled to the Novi Yarylovychi border crossing believing it was open which was not the case Israel Public Broadcasting tweeted. Ukrainian authorities said the foreigners were warned about the border closure.Ukraine’s border guard service said that 690 pilgrims had gathered along the border by Tuesday and the agency’s director Serhiy Deyneko said that more were expected on charter flights arriving in Belarus. Belarusian media reported a different number of pilgrims on the border saying about 1500 had already arrived.Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky said that the border closure will be enforced until it expires on Sept. 28. The country has reported nearly 20000 new virus cases over the past week bringing the total to more than 160000 according to a Times database.Reporting was contributed by Sarah Almukhtar Matt Apuzzo Emma Bubola Emily Cochrane Shaila Dewan Nicholas Fandos Antonella Francini Rick Gladstone Jennifer Jett Anemona Hartocollis Eric Lipton Salman Masood Donald G.

Louisville reaches a $12 million settlement with family of Breonna Taylor,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/9/15/21437956/louisville-breonna-taylor-settlement,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The city of Louisville Kentucky has agreed to a $12 million financial settlement with the family of Breonna Taylor the 26-year-old EMT who police shot to death in her apartment during a late-night raid in March according to the New York Times. The details of the settlement are expected to be announced on Tuesday afternoon at a press conference with Mayor Greg Fischer and attorneys for the Taylor family. The deal is reportedly the biggest payout made by police in the city’s history the Washington Post reports. In 2012 Louisville paid out $8.5 million to Edwin Chandler who was wrongfully imprisoned for almost a decade after a law enforcement official committed perjury according to the Courier Journal. The settlement with Taylor’s family which comes after weeks of private talks and negotiations also includes policing reforms such as a “requirement that commanders approve all search warrants before they go to a judge” a source told the Courier Journal. The settlement also reportedly states that officers who choose to live within city lines will receive housing credits and officers involved in any shooting would be drug- and alcohol-tested. Sam Aguiar an attorney for Taylor’s family said the city’s handling of the case has been “slow and frustrating” but hopes the settlement can be “a turning point” for substantial police reform. In the 186 days since Taylor’s death activists have led demonstrations around the country to demand that the police be held accountable and that the city council defund the police. While the police budget adopted in late June didn’t begin to reduce the department’s funding the Louisville Metro Council voted unanimously to ban no-knock warrants. On the night of her death police relied on a no-knock warrant to enter Taylor’s apartment — police say they announced themselves but Taylor’s boyfriend Kenneth Walker who was inside the apartment at the time disputes that claim. In search of two people suspected of selling drugs neither of whom was Taylor police used a battering ram to enter the space. They fired 20 rounds hitting Taylor eight times. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron the special prosecutor in the case is quietly conducting an investigation into the fatal shooting to determine whether the three officers involved should face criminal charges. A grand jury may hear the details of the case as soon as this week according to multiple reports. Taylor’s mother Tamika L. Palmer has urged the attorney general to charge all three officers — Brett Hankison John Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove. During the course of the investigation the Louisville Metro Police Department terminated Hankison because he “displayed an extreme indifference to the value of human life” when he “wantonly and blindly” fired 10 rounds into Taylor’s apartment according to his termination letter. He has since appealed the termination. Mattingly and Cosgrove were placed on administrative reassignment.

Why some counterprotests to Black Lives Matter are turning violent,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/9/14/21432330/counterprotests-black-lives-matter-violent,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Saturday September 5 was supposed to be the day Louisville reveled in one of its most celebrated traditions — the Kentucky Derby — the coronavirus notwithstanding. Instead much of the attention on the city that day was directed to just outside the dirt track at Churchill Downs where the Louisville Metro Police Department and the National Guard assembled tall barricades in anticipation of protesters calling for results in the Breonna Taylor case which has seen little movement in the seven months since the about-to-be-27-year-old was fatally shot by police in her home. Protesters showed up — and so did armed militia. While there were no spectators in the stands (fans were all virtual) hundreds of armed members of NFAC — the Not Fucking Around Coalition — positioned themselves on the grass outside the complex hours before the event. The group of Black men and women assembled with weapons and announced themselves to the police as “the response not the threat.” “We had hoped to come back to Louisville to celebrate a victory with these people. We had hoped that [the Taylor case] would have been closed” the group’s leader John “Grandmaster Jay” Johnson said at Saturday’s event. Some in the Black community had previously urged Churchill Downs to cancel the Kentucky Derby to show solidarity with the fight for racial justice. But the group dispersed before the Derby even began when a white militia group appeared. Though Johnson told reporters he had an agreement with local police departments about NFAC’s presence he said the agreement was breached when that other armed collective — who said they were there to protect the city against NFAC — was allowed in the same space. Meanwhile a few miles away in downtown Louisville Black Lives Matter protesters clashed with members of the far-right armed militia group American Patriots USA earlier in the day. Protesters carried Black Lives Matter flags and chanted “Breonna Taylor” as the counterprotesters carried Trump Keep America Great flags and chanted “USA” and “Back the Blue” referring to police. Protests against police violence and for racial justice have been happening around the country since May when video of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd went viral. While counterprotesters have been showing up in cities for just as long in recent weeks tensions have gotten more heated and violence at the hands of extremists has turned fatal. That same Labor Day weekend protesters and armed militia gathered in the streets of other cities in the wake of other deadly clashes. On Labor Day more than 1000 supporters of Trump including Patriot Prayer supporters QAnon conspiracy theory supporters and members of the Proud Boys gathered in northwest Oregon to express support for the president and Aaron Danielson a Patriot Prayer supporter who was killed in a clash the previous weekend in Portland by Michael Rienoehl who considered himself an antifa supporter. Protesters also clashed with police and counterprotesters in Rochester over the previous police killing of Daniel Prude leading to the resignation of top law enforcement officials. “We first went out thinking it would be a peaceful protest but things turned on the first night” said Danielle Ponder a public defender based in Rochester who has protested every night since the video of Prude’s killing was released on September 2. “We were met with pepper spray completely unprovoked. It was like war unlike anything I’ve ever seen. We can’t stop now and I hope this empowers people to demand more.” The intensity and frequency of these clashes makes it apparent that there will be more to come as summer draws to a close and with two months until Election Day. And protesters have made it clear that they will not stop until justice is delivered. Far-right counterprotesters on the other hand are feeling greater pressure to maintain the status quo of a Trump presidency. Add local and federal officials calling in more police or the National Guard as a solution and tensions only rise. The chaos could result in more division and deaths taking the focus off one of the largest civil rights movement in history and its mission to seek justice for Black lives. Why clashes are on the rise and in the headlines A new report from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project in collaboration with Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative identified 7750 Black Lives Matter protests from May 26 through August 22 at 2400 locations across the US. An examination of these events found that 93 percent of them remained peaceful while protests at about 220 locations turned “violent” — defined as the destruction of property and including clashes between protesters and police and counterprotesters. The report also found that in these places the violence was restricted to specific blocks of the city and not widespread. Yet despite the fact that protests remained largely peaceful over the course of about four months the report warned that a hyper-polarized environment spurred by state forces that take “a more heavy-handed approach to dissent” will only make non-state actors “more active and assertive” and that counterdemonstrators will “resolve their political disputes in the street” ahead of the election. “Without significant mitigation efforts these risks will continue to intensify in the lead-up to the vote” the authors wrote. The report also noted the National Guard had been deployed across the country at least 55 times since the killing of George Floyd in late May which has only inflamed tensions. It also found that government forces disproportionately used force — fired tear gas rubber bullets and pepper spray or beat protesters with batons — when intervening in Black Lives Matter protests relative to other kinds of demonstrations. In Portland for example federal agents were sent to ostensibly keep the peace in July but instead used excessive force and detained people in unmarked vehicles only reescalating tensions. After the deployment of Department of Homeland Security agents in Portland “the percentage of violent demonstrations has risen from under 17% to over 42% suggesting that the federal response has only aggravated unrest” the report states. Counterprotest activity is also on the rise a trend that can quickly escalate the number of violent clashes according to the report: Between 24 May and 22 August over 360 counter-protests were recorded around the country accounting for nearly 5% of all demonstrations. Of these 43 — nearly 12% — turned violent with clashes between pro-police demonstrators and demonstrators associated with the BLM movement for example. In July alone ACLED records over 160 counter-protests or more than 8% of all demonstrations. Of these 18 turned violent. In the nights following the police shooting of Jacob Blake on August 23 in Kenosha Wisconsin armed counterprotesters visited the city to purportedly protect it from looting and vandalism. One such vigilante 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse fatally shot two people and injured another and was later charged with first-degree intentional homicide. This unrest would give rise to more unrest in Portland where Trump supporters clashed with antifa members — both groups separate from peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters — resulting in the death of Danielson. Clashes will only continue to increase if police and state and federal officials continue their heavy-handed approach to demonstrators. “The current administration seems to thrive in the context of disorder so you can imagine that there’s going to be more which is just going to spin off confrontations” University of Michigan political scientist Christian Davenport told Vox. The recent clashes have historical precedent rooted in the urban disturbances of the 1960s and ’70s. Beginning in 1964 tensions between Black demonstrators and law enforcement caused riots across cities like Rochester Philadelphia and Newark. By 1967 hundreds of cities had experienced long hot summers marked by urban rebellion and unrest. Ponder too sees the resemblance to the civil rights movement. “State troopers were out there with tanks and dogs!” she said of the current Rochester protests. “I’m out there wearing a T-shirt and jeans and we are being met by people flanked in complete military uniforms and officers in riot gear. It felt like a complete war zone. At one point we ran into a church. And I just kept thinking ‘We’re hiding from our government in a church.’ They even pepper sprayed the outside of the church!” Because of these historical connections there are dueling performances Davenport said. “To what extent can protesters stay seemingly nonviolent but persistent?” While the Black Lives Matter protesters are there to draw attention to systemic oppression the presence of the far-right counterprotesters represents a desire to resist social change. “These people aren’t upset. They believe they are protecting that which they see as the natural order. They see these other people as the heretics and the threat” Davenport said. And the increased presence of other non-state actors like antifa and the NFAC serves to “openly intimidate perceived ‘enemies’” like the counterprotesters according to the report. Though violence has not erupted every time these groups are present tensions can escalate quickly. In the end counterprotest dynamics tend to squeeze out middle-of-the-road protesters. “We then have a race not to the middle but to the extremes” Davenport said. Making things more complicated and further compromising peaceful protesters is that right-wing counterprotesters and the government have overlapping interests. Some are there with guns touting a need for law and order like the president does and chanting “Back the Blue” to signal their support for the work of law enforcement. In one video from Labor Day weekend a counterprotester told a Black Lives Matter supporter that they were there to support the police but not the “bad eggs” in the police force. “We’re not out here defending the actions of them fucking bad cops. At all. They need justice. But at the same time we can’t blame the actions of just a few on everybody.” Flying next to the counterprotester was a large Trump 2020 flag. “You have an ill-informed group that’s already hostile and a group that has way too much information about their lives and they’re frustrated about what’s going on and you stick these people out in the street with a lackadaisical police effort this does not bode well” Davenport said. Why activists will keep organizing ahead of the election and after it Through all this Black Lives Matter protesters have never shied away from their demands: The desire to completely rethink how criminal justice and law enforcement systems function in America. Ponder says their demands are clear in Rochester. Protesters are calling for the resignation of Mayor Lovely Warren and Deputy Mayor James Smith. They’re asking that the officers involved in Prude’s killing be prosecuted — Prude who had a clinical history of mental illness died after officers put a mesh “spit hood” over his head — and that the city enact “Daniel’s Law” which would prohibit officers from responding to mental health calls for help. They’re also asking for the immediate demilitarization of the police since 86 percent of all adult arrests in Rochester are misdemeanors. Last activists are calling for the defunding of the Rochester Police Department which receives about $100 million per year. The school district’s budget was recently cut by about 20 percent while the police department only received a 5 percent cut Ponder said. And they will continue to be out in the streets much like 93 percent of peaceful demonstrations across the country until their demands are met. The election has little bearing on this. While the election is often thought of as a nice end point used to facilitate mobilization the difficulty with thinking about Black Lives Matter only in the context of the election is losing “the deeper narrative that folks are generationally upset” Davenport said. “It’s not every four years. It’s several decades worth of stuff that led us to this point that Democrats and Republicans are responsible for.” Whether Black Lives Matter activists will choose to shift strategy in an effort to position themselves away from right-wing agents provocateurs particularly ahead of the election is still left to be seen but questions about the connections between clashes and the election may take away from the deeper goals of the movement. “What would this turn into if Black Lives Matter and associates could say ‘Let’s shift the nature of our confrontation with violence-generating agents in a way that allows us to put forward pressure but doesn’t allow our behavior or presence to be manipulated in a manner that could potentially lead to something that facilitates this other narrative. Let’s not participate in what has become the anti-performance of our grievance. We’re not going to be fodder for this war machine’” Davenport said. Ponder meanwhile is thinking about change that needs to start locally in Rochester — “There are thousands of people who could have been Daniel Prude because our officers continue to dehumanize the Black community” — but also hopes the movement will continue to uplift and inspire young people despite the repeated clashes with law enforcement and counterprotesters. “I have never seen such a Black movement. I have never seen so many young Black people in the street protesting” she said. “I hope this empowers them to demand more from their elected officials. And I hope they become the elected officials to really shift the paradigm and transform our system of policing and criminal justice.” Help keep Vox free for all Millions turn to Vox each month to understand what’s happening in the news from the coronavirus crisis to a racial reckoning to what is quite possibly the most consequential presidential election of our lifetimes.

Louisville reaches a $12 million settlement with family of Breonna Taylor,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/9/15/21437956/louisville-breonna-taylor-settlement,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The city of Louisville Kentucky has agreed to a $12 million financial settlement with the family of Breonna Taylor the 26-year-old EMT who police shot to death in her apartment during a late-night raid in March according to the New York Times. The details of the settlement are expected to be announced on Tuesday afternoon at a press conference with Mayor Greg Fischer and attorneys for the Taylor family. The deal is reportedly the biggest payout made by police in the city’s history the Washington Post reports. In 2012 Louisville paid out $8.5 million to Edwin Chandler who was wrongfully imprisoned for almost a decade after a law enforcement official committed perjury according to the Courier Journal. The settlement with Taylor’s family which comes after weeks of private talks and negotiations also includes policing reforms such as a “requirement that commanders approve all search warrants before they go to a judge” a source told the Courier Journal. The settlement also reportedly states that officers who choose to live within city lines will receive housing credits and officers involved in any shooting would be drug- and alcohol-tested. Sam Aguiar an attorney for Taylor’s family said the city’s handling of the case has been “slow and frustrating” but hopes the settlement can be “a turning point” for substantial police reform. In the 186 days since Taylor’s death activists have led demonstrations around the country to demand that the police be held accountable and that the city council defund the police. While the police budget adopted in late June didn’t begin to reduce the department’s funding the Louisville Metro Council voted unanimously to ban no-knock warrants. On the night of her death police relied on a no-knock warrant to enter Taylor’s apartment — police say they announced themselves but Taylor’s boyfriend Kenneth Walker who was inside the apartment at the time disputes that claim. In search of two people suspected of selling drugs neither of whom was Taylor police used a battering ram to enter the space. They fired 20 rounds hitting Taylor eight times. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron the special prosecutor in the case is quietly conducting an investigation into the fatal shooting to determine whether the three officers involved should face criminal charges. A grand jury may hear the details of the case as soon as this week according to multiple reports. Taylor’s mother Tamika L. Palmer has urged the attorney general to charge all three officers — Brett Hankison John Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove. During the course of the investigation the Louisville Metro Police Department terminated Hankison because he “displayed an extreme indifference to the value of human life” when he “wantonly and blindly” fired 10 rounds into Taylor’s apartment according to his termination letter. He has since appealed the termination. Mattingly and Cosgrove were placed on administrative reassignment.

11 ways to fix America’s fundamentally broken democracy,headline,https://www.vox.com/21336225/voting-rights-senate-electoral-college-gerrymandering-supreme-court,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The United States has a president who received nearly 3 million fewer votes than his Democratic opponent. Currently over half the country lives in just nine states which means that less than half of the population controls 82 percent of the Senate. It also means that Republicans hold a majority in the Senate despite the fact that Democratic senators represent more than half of the American people. Intentional efforts to make it harder to vote such as voter ID laws are increasingly common throughout the states — and the Supreme Court frequently approaches such voter suppression with indifference. Gerrymandering renders many legislative elections irrelevant — in 2018 Republicans won nearly two-thirds of the seats in the Wisconsin state assembly even though Democratic candidates received 54 percent of the popular vote. Wealthy donors flood elections with money as lawmakers spend thousands of hours on “call time” dialing the rich to fund the next campaign. And looming over all of this is the problem of race. In some states Republican lawmakers write voter suppression laws that target voters of color with in the word of one federal appeals court “almost surgical precision” knowing that a law that targets minority votes will primarily disenfranchise Democrats. Congressional Democrats are acutely aware of many of these problems. And they’ve devised some fairly aggressive plans to combat these attacks on the franchise. The first bill House Democrats rolled out after they took charge of the House in 2019 was the “For the People Act” which would be the most significant voting rights legislation since the Voting Rights Act of 1965 if it were to become law (that bill is often referred to as “HR 1” its official designation in the House’s internal system for keeping track of bills). A companion bill HR 4 would strengthen the Voting Rights Act and restore many parts of the law that were neutralized by the Supreme Court. As several voting rights advocates told me these two bills represent a hard-won consensus among Democrats and among the voting rights community more broadly on what must be done to shore up American democracy. It’s “taken a long time to build consensus” around this package of proposals according to Wendy Weiser head of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice and one of the advocates who helped build that consensus. And the two House bills that emerged would likely be the most comprehensive voting rights legislation ever enacted by Congress. And yet if enacted House Democrats’ voting rights legislation would still fall short of addressing the major challenges facing our democracy. The bills do little for example to address Senate malapportionment. And nothing to prevent the Electoral College from handing the presidency to popular vote losers. If Democrats’ polling leads hold through November 3 they might have the majorities they need to fix much of America’s broken democracy. But to do so they will have to think big — even bigger than they are already thinking. Below are 11 reforms that Congress could enact in a potential Joe Biden administration. Many of these reforms are included in legislation the House passed. But the list also rather pointedly includes solutions for problems that are not adequately addressed by these two bills. Some of these proposals may seem radical but the ambition of these proposals speaks to the scale of the problems facing us. American democracy is fundamentally broken. And it needs a radical overhaul to ensure that the United States has free and fair elections in the future. It all begins with securing our right to vote The first batch of ideas all aim to do one thing: secure our right to vote. Voter suppression — from voter ID laws to polling place closures to voter roll purges — have compromised many Americans voters’ rights. Strengthening our democracy begins with restoring and bolstering those rights. 1) First things first: Get rid of the filibuster If elected president Biden could potentially do more to protect the franchise than any chief executive since Lyndon Johnson. Or Biden could end up with few if any legislative accomplishments. It all comes down to what a Democratic Congress could pass. Should Democrats win a majority in both houses eyes will turn to the Senate which will have to choose between unraveling the filibuster — which typically prevents any legislation from becoming law unless it is supported by 60 senators — and unraveling hope that major voting rights legislation or any other big progressive legislation will become law. To win a filibuster-proof majority Democrats would need to get to 60 seats from the 47 they currently have — and even if they get that (which is highly unlikely) that would only mean that they had enough votes to pass legislation supported by the most conservative Democrat in the Senate. Barring a historic electoral calamity for the GOP the Republican Party will have enough votes to filibuster any voting rights bill that reaches the Senate floor unless Democrats vote to strip away the filibuster. There are signs that Democrats are starting to understand this problem. At Rep. John Lewis’s (D-GA) funeral in July former President Barack Obama called for eliminating the filibuster which he called a “Jim Crow relic” if necessary to enact voting rights legislation. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) once one of the most vocal Democratic defenders of the filibuster now appears likely to vote to kill it if Republicans use it to sabotage a Biden administration. Biden himself signaled support in July for filibuster reform if Senate Republicans are too “obstreperous” although his advisers have cast doubt on the prospect. The success of a Biden presidency could rest on whether the Senate has the votes to make Republican obstreperousness irrelevant. 2) Stop voting rights violations before they happen A perennial problem in voting rights litigation: When a state enacts an illegal restriction on the franchise it takes courts several years to strike that law down. In Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill (2019) for example the Supreme Court allowed a lower court decision invalidating an unconstitutional racial gerrymander to go into effect. But that was after the state held several elections using these illegal maps. As Lisa Cylar Barrett director of policy for the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund told me we need a “mechanism that allows for the screening” of voting laws “before elections happen.” Which brings us to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Section 5 required states and localities with a history of racial voter suppression to “preclear” any new voting rules with the Justice Department or with a federal court in Washington DC. The idea was to catch efforts at voter suppression before they disenfranchise voters and before a state can run an election using racist rules. But the Supreme Court effectively deactivated Section 5 in Shelby County v. Holder (2013). Though the Court’s 5-4 decision in Shelby County did not strike down Section 5’s preclearance regime altogether it did invalidate the formula the Voting Rights Act used to determine which states are subject to preclearance. HR 4 is the House Democratic proposal to address Shelby County. It lays out a new formula: jurisdictions with “fifteen or more voting rights violations” in the previous 15 years or states with “ten or more voting rights violations” if at least one was committed by the state itself will be subject to preclearance under the regime laid out in the bill. One problem with this regime is that preclearance is only as good as the officials who oversee it. A Justice Department led by Attorney General Bill Barr is likely to rubber stamp voter suppression laws that benefit Republicans as could Trump-appointed judges. Yet as Franita Tolson a law professor and vice dean at the University of Southern California told me “there have always been bad actors.” And yet she argues ”preclearance was still effective in the Reagan years” and “it was still effective in the Bush years.” Tolson says the fact that states have to submit new voting laws for approval has a “substantial deterrent effect” because they are less likely to even attempt to obtain preclearance for the most egregious acts of racial voter suppression. And even if states do obtain preclearance for a bad law the preclearance process is burdensome in and of itself. Which raises another important aspect of HR 4 — in addition to laying out a formula governing jurisdictions that are automatically subject to preclearance the bill also makes it easier for federal judges to require states to preclear new laws if states or localities are caught violating voting rights. Currently judges may only do so if a jurisdiction violates the 14th or 15th Amendment rights of voters — violations that typically can only be established if the state intentionally engaged in racial voter discrimination. HR 4 allows judges to impose preclearance on states and localities that commit “violations of the 14th or 15th Amendment violations of this Act or violations of any Federal law that prohibits discrimination in voting on the basis of race color or membership in a language minority group.” In practice that means that a jurisdiction could be subject to preclearance if it enacts a law that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color” even if the plaintiffs challenging this law cannot prove intentional discrimination. Just as significantly the possibility that a jurisdiction might be subjected to a burdensome preclearance regime if it engages in racial voter suppression may deter it from attempting to do so. 3) Eliminate registration as an obstacle to voting At least 21 states plus the District of Columbia permit voters to register to vote on the same day that they cast their ballot — thus effectively eliminating the need to register in advance as an obstacle to the franchise. Nor is same-day registration a particularly new reform. Maine Minnesota and Wisconsin adopted it in the 1970s. Three more states — Idaho New Hampshire and Wyoming — adopted same-day registration in the mid-’90s. One benefit of eliminating registration as an obstacle to voting is that it prevents voter purges that can change the outcome of an election. In the lead-up to the 2000 election for example Florida hired a private contractor to identify ineligible voters on the state’s rolls. The contractor eventually came up with about 100000 names that it claimed were names of dead voters or voters who were ineligible because of a felony conviction. But the list was deeply flawed and misidentified many eligible voters. One local election supervisor realized just how flawed the list was when he recognized the name of three voters who were wrongly flagged as ineligible: one of his co-workers the husband of a different co-worker and his own father. African Americans a group that preferred Democrat Al Gore over Republican George W. Bush by more than 9 to 1 were particularly likely to appear on the flawed purge list. Bush would go on to win Florida — and with it the presidency — by just 537 votes according to official tallies. The HR 1 legislation contains several provisions that would help prevent a repeat of this incident and that would otherwise prevent registration from being an obstacle to the franchise. Among other things it requires states to offer same-day registration in federal elections. It automatically registers voters who provide relevant information to their local Department of Motor Vehicles or other agencies listed in the bill. And it forbids certain types of voter purges. 4) Make it as easy as possible to vote Thirty-nine states plus the District of Columbia allow early voting — meaning that voters can vote in-person prior to Election Day. All but nine states either automatically mail ballots to all registered voters or allow any voter who wishes to vote absentee to request a ballot. In ordinary times these reforms help ensure that voters are not disenfranchised because they cannot take time off work on Election Day or because they will be away from home on that day. And in the midst of a pandemic they help ensure that polling places do not become vectors for the spread of Covid-19. They limit the number of voters who vote in person and spread out those voters who do cast an in-person ballot over several days. HR 1 would require all states to offer early voting for at least 10 hours a day and for at least 15 days prior to Election Day. Notably this includes weekends — some states have attempted to cut Sunday voting a day that is particularly popular with African American voters because Black churches frequently organize voting drives immediately after Sunday services. The legislation also requires states to allow all voters to vote absentee. Additionally HR 1 says states that require voters to present ID at the polls generally must also accept “a sworn written statement signed by the individual under penalty of perjury attesting to the individual’s identity and attesting that the individual is eligible to vote in the election.” Voter ID laws are a common obstacle to the franchise but they serve no legitimate purpose. Although proponents of such laws often argue they are necessary to prevent voter fraud voter impersonation at the polls is so rare that it is virtually nonexistent. 5) Stop running elections on the cheap Many state election officials face a “dramatic funding gap” thanks to the pandemic Weiser the lawyer with the Brennan Center told me. Numerous states expect a crush of absentee ballot requests from voters who wish to avoid physically going to polling places where they could contract Covid-19. And the workers who staff polling places tend to be older retired voters who are especially likely to stay at home out of fear of becoming sick. Solving these problems requires money — money to hire staff to process absentee ballot requests money to hire people to sort and count those ballots once they are cast and money to pay poll workers enough that people actually want to take the job. And right now that money isn’t there. Even after the pandemic is over however Weiser warns that the United States has ”always run on a shoestring.” Especially now that we are facing “more and more hostile foreign government affiliated actors” states need adequate funding to secure our elections. A Democratic Congress which has few constraints on its ability to borrow money during a period of low inflation and even lower interest rates would be well-positioned to provide those funds. 6) A tax credit for all voters In Australia over 90 percent of eligible voters typically cast a ballot in federal elections. The nation achieves this feat by turning Election Day into a celebration where voters gather at community barbecues to eat what are often referred to as “democracy sausages.” But Australia also uses a stick to encourage voting — nonvoters can be fined about $80 Australian dollars (about $60 in US currency) if they do not cast a ballot. If a similar proposal were enacted here according to a recent report by the Brookings Institution and the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard Kennedy School it would enhance the voice of Americans who are often underrepresented in US democracy. “The country’s politics typically places the interests of older Americans over the interests of the younger generations” for example because older more financially stable voters are more likely to cast a ballot. Similarly a universal duty to vote “would also help ensure increased political participation in communities of color that have long confronted exclusion from our democracy.” One possible argument against fining nonvoters it that such fines could impose a hardship on the poorest Americans (although in the long run federal policy would likely grow much more favorable to low-income Americans if voting were mandatory). Realistically moreover the current Supreme Court is unlikely to allow a mandatory voting law in the United States. In NFIB v. Sebelius (2012) the first major Obamacare case to reach the justices the Court famously invented a distinction between laws that regulate people already engaged in a particular activity and laws that regulate “inactivity” — that is laws that compel passive individuals to act in a way they would prefer not to act. With five Republican justices the Court could easily import this distinction into the voting rights context. But NFIB also provides a potential path forward if Congress wants to incentivize voters to show up at the polls without relying on fines. NFIB upheld a provision of Obamacare that required most Americans to either carry health insurance or pay higher taxes as a valid exercise of Congress’s power to tax. And Congress’s power to reward certain behavior with favorable tax treatment is extremely broad. It can use tax credits to encourage people to drive hybrid cars or even to encourage them to have more children. Barring an extraordinarily partisan decision from the Supreme Court Congress should also be able to use tax credits to encourage people to vote. In that vein instead of fining voters $60 for not voting (or whatever amount Congress deems appropriate) Congress could provide a tax credit of $60 to everyone who casts a vote. As a bonus Congress could make this a refundable tax credit — meaning it would be available to the poorest Americans who pay little or no income tax. Making American democracy more democratic Beyond protecting our right to vote policymakers need to think bigger to ensure that every voter has an equal say in shaping our government. There are major structural reasons why America’s political system has ground to a halt and produced outcomes that don’t seem to reflect public will. What follows are ambitious solutions but we need ambitious thinking to fix a democracy in serious disrepair. 7) Fix Senate malapportionment The United States Senate is simultaneously one of our most anti-democratic institutions and one of the most powerful bastions of systemic racism in our political system. According to 2019 census population estimates the state of California has nearly 40 million residents. The state of Wyoming meanwhile has fewer than 600000 residents. Yet each state receives two senators. In practice that means that each resident of Wyoming has 68 times more representation in the Senate than each Californian. This malapportionment has profound partisan implications and profound racial implications. In the current Senate Democrats control a majority of the Senate seats (26-24) in the most populous half of the states. Republicans owe their majority in the Senate as a whole to their crushing 29-21 lead in the least populous half of the states. Meanwhile white voters are over-represented in the smaller states that benefit from Senate malapportionment and non-college educated whites — a demographic that is trending rapidly toward Republicans — are especially over-represented in these states. The Senate in other words effectively gives additional representation to white Americans and dilutes the voting power of people of color. Democrats have rallied behind a partial solution to this problem — statehood for the District of Columbia. The Democratic House voted to make DC a state in June and Congress has the power to make DC a state through ordinary legislation. Accordingly if Democrats control the House the White House and a (filibuster-free) Senate DC statehood is likely to happen fairly quickly. Yet while admitting a heavily Democratic majority-minority city like DC into the union would help mitigate many of the problems with the Senate it would hardly overcome them. Among other things while admitting DC would reduce Black under-representation in the Senate it would also increase the power of white college grads. More radical solutions are possible for example breaking up larger states such as California into smaller states. Absent such solutions the Senate will continue to over-represent white conservatives and potentially even become a permanent bastion of Republican Party power. 8) Allow the states to neutralize the Electoral College The popular vote loser has become president in two of the last five presidential elections. Nor is this problem likely to fix itself. A recent study by three University of Texas researchers found that a Democrat who wins the presidential popular vote by 3 percentage points still has about a one in six chance of losing the Electoral College. There is a small chance that a Republican president will be elected even if the Democratic candidate wins the popular vote by as much as 6 points. Congress cannot abolish the Electoral College on its own — the college itself is written into the Constitution — but it can help hasten its irrelevance. A proposal known as the National Popular Vote Compact would allow the states to effectively neutralize the Electoral College. It works like this: A bloc of states that control a majority of electoral votes all agree to allocate those votes to the winner of the national popular vote. That way no matter who wins each individual state a majority of the Electoral College will always vote for the popular vote winner. Currently 15 states plus the District of Columbia which combined control 196 electoral votes have signed onto the compact. The compact will take effect once a bloc of states that control at least 270 votes sign on. But there is a catch. The Constitution provides that no state may enter into a compact with another state “without the consent of Congress.” Though there is a plausible argument that the National Popular Vote Compact does not require such consent it is uncertain how this argument will fare in court. Congress could avoid this problem altogether however by preemptively giving consent to any compact that seeks to neutralize the Electoral College’s ability to place popular vote losers in the White House. 9) Stop gerrymandering States must redraw their legislative districts at least once every decade to ensure that each district has roughly the same number of people. That means the party that dominates the election prior to a redistricting cycle can often entrench its own power by drawing maps that neutralize many of the other party’s voters. That’s more or less what happened in many states after Republicans had an unusually strong performance in the 2010 elections. In Pennsylvania for example President Obama won the state by more than 5 percentage points in 2012 — the first election held under the new Republican gerrymanders — but Republicans still won 13 of the state’s 18 US House seats. In Michigan Obama won by nearly 10 points but Republicans won nine of 14 House seats. Unlike the problems of Senate malapportionment and the Electoral College however congressional Democrats have rallied behind a potent solution to gerrymandering at least in federal elections. The HR 1 legislation would require nearly every state to use a 15-member redistricting commission to draw US House districts. This commission must include equal numbers of Democrats Republicans and independents and at least one member of each party and one independent must approve final maps. If the commission cannot draw maps or if a state refuses to appoint such a commission then congressional maps will be drawn by a panel of three federal judges. It’s not a perfect solution. It’s possible that despite considerable safeguards written into the legislation commissioners sympathetic to one party or the other may gain control of the commission. It’s also possible that a state may decide to forgo the commission and take its chances with the courts — especially if the majority party in that state believes that the local federal judges are loyal partisans. But it’s a much better solution than leaving redistricting to state legislatures bodies that by their very nature will very often be captured by a single political party. 10) Public financing for candidates Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United v. FEC (2010) have largely gutted our ability to keep wealthy donors from having a disproportionate impact on elections. The most commonly cited concern about money in politics is corruption because the need to raise money forces politicians to ingratiate themselves to big donors if they wish to remain in office. But money in politics also has an equally pernicious effect on how lawmakers spend their time. As former Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) wrote shortly before he retired from Congress in 2016 “I’ve spent roughly 4200 hours in call time attended more than 1600 fund-raisers just for my own campaign and raised nearly $20 million in increments of $1000 $2500 and $5000 per election cycle. And things have only become worse in the five years since the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision.” Members of Congress spend a simply astonishing amount of time raising money and that’s time they can’t spend doing their actual job of informing themselves about the bills they will vote into law. One way to mitigate this problem is public financing which provides additional funds to candidates who agree to certain restrictions on their ability to raise money from large donors. HR 1 would create such a regime for House candidates. Under the legislation qualified candidates receive six dollars for every one that they raise from most donors who give $200 or less. Thus the bill makes it easier for candidates to get elected to Congress without relying on the wealthiest individuals to fund their campaigns. It also potentially allows them to spend less time on fundraising freeing them to actually do their job. 11) Prevent Trump’s judges from sabotaging voting reforms Any voting rights law is likely to receive a tough hearing from a Supreme Court that has only gotten more conservative since Shelby County. And any law enacted by a Democratic Congress could be struck down by overly partisan federal judges. Republicans have proven quite adept in shopping for federal trial judges who will strike down progressive laws on the thinnest legal arguments. And Trump has filled the federal bench with hardline conservatives many of whom would be happy to strike down a law that makes it easier for voters of color — and for Democratic-leaning voters in general — to cast a ballot. But Congress is hardly powerless against such judges. While the Constitution created the Supreme Court it only provides for “such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.” Thus because lower federal courts are entirely creations of Congress Congress may determine the scope of any lower court’s jurisdiction. It could for example strip courts that are known to be stacked with Republican partisans of jurisdiction to hear any lawsuit challenging new voting rights legislation. It could also require all such suits to be brought in the federal district court in DC — thus ensuring that any decision blocking such legislation would appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit where reactionary judges likely to toss out voting rights laws for partisan reasons can be outvoted by their more numerous colleagues. Alternatively Congress could create a new court — call it the “United States Court for Voting Rights Appeals” — and route any lower court decision challenging a voting rights law to that Court which would be filled with new judges appointed by the sitting president. Congress’s ability to shape the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction is far more uncertain and the Court’s own decisions on this point are not a model of clarity. It is unlikely that a Republican Supreme Court would allow a Democratic Congress to strip its authority to hear certain lawsuits altogether. But Congress might be able to impose limited restrictions on the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction. It might for example strip the Supreme Court of its power to stay a lower court decision enforcing a voting rights law while that case is still being litigated in lower courts. This act of Congress wouldn’t prevent the Supreme Court from striking the voting rights law down after the case is fully litigated in trial court and by an intermediate appeals court. But it could prevent the Supreme Court from immediately stepping in to block new voting rights legislation from ever taking effect. In any event a Democratic Congress will need to think hard about how to deal with partisan judges if it doesn’t want its laws to be quickly sabotaged by those judges. And that means thinking creatively about how to prevent judicial partisans from reviewing those laws.

What we know about a deadly shooting in Portland, Oregon,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/8/30/21407398/portland-oregon-shooting,www.vox.com,1600223579509
A shooter killed one person in Portland Oregon on Saturday night according to a statement by the Portland Police Bureau. Details are still emerging but the victim is believed to be Aaron Danielson a supporter of the far-right Patriot Prayer group; according to Willamette Week reporter Aaron Mesh the victim was wearing a hat and shirt with the group’s logo. The shooting comes after supporters of President Donald Trump led a caravan of vehicles through the city Saturday and clashed with anti-police brutality protesters in Portland’s downtown; video from journalist Cory Elia shows trucks flying Trump flags driving through people on a street and unleashing pepper spray as the vehicles forced their way through a crowd of protesters. At least 10 people were arrested Saturday by Portland police on a variety of charges including disorderly conduct and “interfering with a peace officer” but no arrests have been made in connection with the shooting. The killing follows another instance of deadly street violence from just days ago: On Tuesday a 17-year-old Trump supporter allegedly shot and killed two protesters in the city of Kenosha Wisconsin and injured a third. Kenosha has been the site of major protests since police shot Jacob Blake a Black man at least seven times in the back on Sunday leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Early Sunday Trump issued a string of tweets and retweets including one retweet and a tweet condemning Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s leadership of the city. “The National Guard is Ready Willing and Able” to deploy Trump wrote in a quote tweet shortly after calling Wheeler a “fool.” Trump has attempted to paint himself as the “law and order” candidate ahead of the general election in November and all signs point to his campaign believing that more violence is good for the president’s reelection chances. Specifically senior adviser to the president Kellyanne Conway told Fox & Friends on Thursday that “the more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns the better it is for the very clear choice on who’s best on public safety and law and order” — an odd message given the violence is happening under the Trump administration and Democratic nominee Joe Biden hasn’t held elected office since January 2017. Trump himself has argued that increasing unrest and recent violence is the result of Democratic leadership at the local level rather than the result of any of his policies or rhetoric. In a statement Sunday Biden reacted to the shooting by saying he condemned the violence “unequivocally.” “We must not become a country at war with ourselves” Biden said. “But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be the America he believes we are. As a country we must condemn the incitement of hate and resentment that led to this deadly clash.” Portland has been the site of continuous Black Lives Matter protests for approximately three months following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis Minnesota in May. Federal agents were deployed to the city in July and armed far-right protesters have been a frequent presence as well. The story is still developing. Here’s what we know and don’t know so far. What we know The Oregonian reports that the victim’s name was Aaron Danielson a supporter of the far-right group Patriot Prayer. Danielson was shot in the chest at around 8:46 pm Pacific time and died at the scene. Joey Gibson the leader of Patriot Prayer confirmed Danielson’s affiliation with the group to local NBC News affiliate KGW’s Tim Gordon on Sunday. “I can confirm that he was a good friend and supporter of Patriot Prayer” Gibson said. A 48-year-old man Michael Forest Reinoehl is reportedly under investigation for the shooting according to the Oregonian. The shooting comes after Trump supporters in downtown Portland unleashed pepper spray and paintballs on protesters and journalists and amid clashes between supporters of the president and protesters. Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf told ABC Sunday morning that “all options continue to be on the table” in terms of federal action in Portland.

Why we can’t stop fighting about cancel culture,headline,https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/12/30/20879720/what-is-cancel-culture-explained-history-debate,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The 2020 Republican National Convention kicked off with an evening of programming that seemed deeply fixated on one of the odder ideas to snowball its way into the zeitgeist: cancel culture. Within the turbulent past several years the idea that a person can be “canceled” — in other words culturally blocked from having a prominent public platform or career — has become a polarizing topic of debate. The rise of “cancel culture” and the idea of canceling someone coincides with a familiar pattern: A celebrity or other public figure does or says something offensive. A public backlash often fueled by politically progressive social media ensues. Then come the calls to cancel the person — that is to effectively end their career or revoke their cultural cachet whether through boycotts of their work or disciplinary action from an employer. The argument that this phenomenon has spun out of control loomed over the RNC during its first few days of programming. Prior to the first night of speakers delegates voted for a number of resolutions in meetings that were closed to the press one of which specifically targeted cancel culture — the “Resolution Upholding The First Amendment To The Constitution Of The United States Of America In The Response To The Coronavirus Pandemic And The Cancel Culture Movement.” The resolution described “cancel culture” as having “grown into erasing of history encouraging lawlessness muting citizens and violating free exchange of ideas thoughts and speech.” Then during Monday night’s lineup several speakers mentioned cancel culture. Former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle portrayed it as a culture of “elites ... who blame America” and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) stressed that Republicans “don’t give into cancel culture or the radical and factly baseless beliefs that things are worse today than in the 1860s or the 1960s.” Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley described cancel culture as “an important issue. [Trump] knows that political correctness and cancel culture are dangerous and just plain wrong” she told viewers. “You cannot cancel a culture that love its heroes” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fl) said referring obliquely to the nationwide trend of toppling Confederate statues in protests against racism. But despite the urgency of these speeches actually ending someone’s career through the power of public backlash is easier said than done. Few entertainers or other public figures have truly been canceled — that is they haven’t had their careers totally shut down by negative criticism on the internet. For example during 2020 alone a number of people and institutions have faced public backlash for platforming anti-progressive values. Prominent journalists like New York Times food critic Alison Roman former Times opinion writer Bari Weiss and the Times opinion section itself all came under fire for racism and other issues. Food media empire Bon Appetit faces ongoing backlash over accusations the company fosters systemic racism; and Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling faced intense criticism from her own fans after she began to voice transphobic beliefs. But few of those people have since faced serious repercussions. Times opinion editor James Bennet resigned after publishing one of the most inflammatory opinion pieces in the paper’s recent history after which Weiss left the paper of her own volition — but both he and Weiss were immediately embraced by prominent Republicans and moderates who saw them as cancel culture victims. Bon Appetit’s editor-in-chief resigned after he was caught posing in brownface but the company has forged past the blowback with a new executive editor (who is both a woman of color and a former employee of Vox Media). Alison Roman was placed on a temporary hiatus from the Times following a controversial social media argument she had with Chrissy Teigen but her popularity continues unabated and her latest cookbook is currently a No. 1 Amazon bestseller. And following her most recent transphobic screed in June sales of Rowling’s books actually increased tremendously in her home country of Great Britain. And though many of the most prominent examples of cancellation have arrived in the Me Too era most of the men who have faced accusations have also dodged long-term consequences. After multiple women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2017 Louis C.K.’s career hiatus lasted only around 10 months before he returned to stand-up comedy and performed dozens of sold-out controversial shows. After high-profile documentaries exploring allegations of decades of sexual assault against each of them were released earlier this year both R. Kelly and the late Michael Jackson saw increases in streams of their music rather than decreases. Continued support for those who have been canceled demonstrates that instead of costing someone their careers attempting to cancel someone can encourage sympathy for the offender. Yet to hear Shane Gillis (who lost a job at Saturday Night Live in 2019 after his racist and homophobic jokes came to light) and many others talk about cancel culture you might think it’s some sort of “celebrity hunting season” — an unstoppable force descending to ruin the careers of anyone who dares to push society’s moral boundaries. This framing frequently portrays the offender as the victim of reckless vigilante justice. “There are very few people that have gone through what they have losing everything in a day” comedian Norm MacDonald said in a 2018 interview referring to canceled comedians like C.K. and Roseanne Barr. “Of course people will go ‘What about the victims?’ But you know what? The victims didn’t have to go through that.” So which is it? Is cancel culture an important tool of social justice or a new form of merciless mob intimidation? If canceling someone usually doesn’t work does cancel culture even exist? Or does the very idea of being canceled work to deter potentially bad behavior? These questions have received more and more mainstream consideration over the past few years as the idea of cancel culture itself has evolved from its humorous origins into a broader and more serious conversation about how to hold public figures accountable for bad behavior. And the conversation isn’t just about when and how public figures should lose their status and their livelihoods. It’s also about establishing new ethical and social norms and figuring out how to collectively respond when those norms are violated. “Canceling” came out of the unlikeliest place: a misogynistic joke Given how frequently it’s been used to repudiate sexism and misogyny it’s ironic that the concept of “canceling” shares its DNA with a misogynistic joke. Possibly the first reference to canceling someone comes with the 1991 film New Jack City in which Wesley Snipes plays a gangster named Nino Brown. In one scene after his girlfriend breaks down because of all the violence he’s causing he dumps her by saying “Cancel that bitch. I’ll buy another one.” (We reportedly owe this witticism to screenwriter Barry Michael Cooper.) Jump to 2010 when Lil Wayne referenced the film in a line from his song “I’m Single”: “Yeah I’m single / n***a had to cancel that bitch like Nino.” This callback to the earlier sexist cancel joke probably helped the phrase percolate for a while. But canceling seems to have gotten its first big boost into the zeitgeist from an episode of VH1’s reality show Love and Hip-Hop: New York that aired in December 2014 in which cast member Cisco Rosado tells his love interest Diamond Strawberry during a fight “you’re canceled.” Even with zero context it’s a hilarious moment: The quote began to appear on social media shortly after the episode aired. From there the idea of canceling began to disseminate from Black Twitter throughout 2015 used as a reaction to someone doing something you disapproved of — either jokingly or seriously. As it caught on however the term began to evolve into a way of responding not just to friends or acquaintances but also to celebrities or entities whose behavior offended you. And even early on canceling someone often involved boycotting them professionally as the tweets below demonstrate: Even though these early examples are largely independent and distinct from one another they contained the seeds of what cancel culture would become: a trend of communal calls to boycott a celebrity whose offensive behavior is perceived as going too far. It’s common to compare cancel culture to “call-out culture” — but its real roots may lie in the civil rights movement As cancel culture caught on many members of the public as well as the media have frequently conflated it with other adjacent trends — especially “call-out culture.” Cancel culture can be seen as an extension of call-out culture: the natural escalation from pointing out a problem to calling for the head of the person who caused it. Cancel culture and call-out culture are often confused not only with each other but also with broader public shaming trends as part of a collectivized narrative that all of these things are examples of trolling and harassment. The media sometimes refers to this idea as “outrage culture.” But while these ideas seem interchangeable at a glance they’re different in important ways. Call-out culture predates cancel culture as a concept with online roots in early 2010s Tumblr fandom callout blogs like Your Fave is Problematic and spreading from there. Call-out culture is a term that arose within fandom used by fans of all kinds deploying criticism of pop culture or public figures in inherent opposition to toxic online harassment mobs like Gamergate. Meanwhile cancel culture arose within black culture and appears to channel black empowerment movements as far back as the civil rights boycotts of the 1950s and ’60s. “While the terminology of cancel culture may be new and most applicable to social media through Black Twitter in particular the concept of being canceled is not new to black culture” Anne Charity Hudley the chair of linguistics of African America for the University of California Santa Barbara told Vox. Hudley who studies black vernacular and the use of language in cultural conversations like this one described canceling as “a survival skill as old as the Southern black use of the boycott.” Charity Hudley pointed out that canceling someone is akin to a boycott but of a person rather than a business. What’s more it promotes the idea that black people should be empowered to reject the parts of pop culture that spread harmful ideas. “If you don’t have the ability to stop something through political means what you can do is refuse to participate” she said. Thanks to social media black culture in particular has become more widely recognized as the dominant driving force behind much of pop culture. Platforms like Twitter give a louder collective voice to black citizens and other marginalized groups who have traditionally been shunted to the edges of public conversations while platforms like YouTube and Netflix help to diversify and expand the types of media and pop culture we consume. And in a society where cultural participation is increasingly democratized the refusal to participate also becomes more important. “Canceling is a way to acknowledge that you don’t have to have the power to change structural inequality” Charity Hudley said. “You don’t even have to have the power to change all of public sentiment. But as an individual you can still have power beyond measure. “When you see people canceling Kanye canceling other people it’s a collective way of saying ‘We elevated your social status your economic prowess [and] we’re not going to pay attention to you in the way that we once did. ... ‘I may have no power but the power I have is to [ignore] you.’” Cancel culture then serves as a pop culture corrective for the sense of powerlessness that many people feel. But as it’s gained mainstream attention cancel culture has also seemed to gain a more material power — at least in the eyes of the many people who’d like to well cancel it. Very few canceled celebs actually suffer career setbacks. But witnessing cancel culture backlash seems to send some people into panic mode. Some celebrities whose crimes have encompassed allegations of rape and sexual assault and became impossible to ignore like Harvey Weinstein Bill Cosby and Kevin Spacey have effectively been canceled. Along with Roseanne Barr who lost her hit TV show after a racist tweet their offenses were serious enough to irreparably damage their careers alongside a push to lessen their cultural influence. And though it’s still early for author J.K. Rowling her very recent transphobic tweet was so upsetting to Harry Potter fans that large segments of the fandom started openly claiming that Rowling wasn’t the author of their beloved series at all; she was no longer part of the equation. Rowling hasn’t responded to the outrage that fans of Harry Potter have expressed over her transphobic stance but the level of publicity it has received has been damning. And tellingly as of late December Rowling has not returned to Twitter since the initial offending tweet. It’s impossible to truly ignore public scorn at the level that Rowling received. And therein lies cancel culture at its most powerful. “I think it’s clear that a ‘cancel’ campaign is more effective if there is significant embarrassment [involved]” Catherine Squires author of The Post-racial Mystique and a professor of communication studies at the University of Minnesota told Vox in an email. With that potential embarrassment however comes a high degree of alarm. A recent piece in Digiday about cancel culture’s effect on brands and businesses framed it as “mob rule” with one anonymous PR executive declaring “even good intentions get canceled.” In September the New Republic’s Osita Nwanevu observed just how frequently media outlets have compared cancel culture to violent political uprisings ranging from ethnocide to torture under dictatorial regimes. This hyperbole might feel reasonable to someone faced with a social justice mob but to proponents of cancel culture it seems more like a disingenuous slippery slope that really only works to marginalize victims. For example: In 2018 feminist performance artist Emma Sulkowicz designed a protest performance in response to a New York Times article. The article as she later explained to Teen Vogue had asked museum directors if they would remove works by famed artist Chuck Close from their galleries after Close was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment. “I got so upset that survivors’ voices weren’t included in the conversation” Sulkowicz said. “One museum director was like ‘If we go down this road our museum walls will be bare.’ And I thought ‘Do you only show work by evil men?’” The debate around cancel culture is partly about how we treat each other and partly about frustration with the lack of real consequences for powerful people All of this dramatic rhetoric from both sides of the debate shows how incendiary cancel culture has become. As ideological divides seem more and more insurmountable the line between the personal and the political is vanishing for many people. Even though cancel culture seems to generate few lasting consequences for celebrities and their careers some people seem to view it as part of a broader trend they find deeply disturbing: an inability to forgive and move on. Aaron Rose a corporate diversity and inclusion consultant used to identify with progressives who participate in call-out and cancel culture. But now he says he’s focused on objectives like “conflict transformation” motivated by the question of “how do we truly communicate [and] treat each other like humans?” “Mainstream internet activism is a lot of calling out and blaming and shaming” he told Vox in an email. “We have to get honest with ourselves about whether calling out and canceling gives us more than a short-term release of cathartic anger.” Rose “used to think that those tactics created change” he said but eventually realized “that I was not seeing the true change I desired. ... We were still sad and mad. And the bad people were still bad. And everyone was still traumatized.” He says he now wants to “create more stories of transformation rather than stories of punishment and excommunication.” Loretta Ross is a self-identified liberal who’s come to hold a similar position. In an opinion piece for the New York Times she wrote that as a black feminist she finds cancel and call-out culture a “toxic” practice wherein “people attempt to expunge anyone with whom they do not perfectly agree rather than remain focused on those who profit from discrimination and injustice.” In Ross’s view “most public shaming is horizontal” — that is it’s not done to justifiably criticize people who are seriously dangerous but to score brownie points against people who mean no harm. The people doing the canceling she argues “become the self-appointed guardians of political purity.” But among proponents of canceling is a sense that any losses that the canceled person suffers are outweighed by a greater cultural need to change the behavior they’re embodying. “Forgive me if I care less about the comedian who made his own bed versus the people affected by the anti-queer climate he helped create” wrote Esquire’s Michael Arceneaux in response to Hart’s homophobic comments in 2018. “[W]hat people do when they invoke dog whistles like ‘cancel culture’ and ‘culture wars’” Danielle Butler wrote for the Root in 2018 “is illustrate their discomfort with the kinds of people who now have a voice and their audacity to direct it towards figures with more visibility and power.” But to progressives like Rose rejecting cancel culture doesn’t have to mean rejecting the principles of social justice and the push for equality that fuels it. “This does not mean repressing our reactions or giving up on accountability” he told Vox. “On the contrary it means giving ourselves the space to truly honor our feelings of sadness and anger while also not reacting in a way that implies that others are ... incapable of compassion and change.” To Rose and for many opponents of cancel culture the bottom line in the debate is a need to believe that other people can change and treat them with according optimism. The difference between cancel culture and a more reconciliatory transformational approach to a disagreement is “the difference between expecting amends and never letting a wound close” he said. “Between expressing your rage and identifying with it forever.” “I get that but that’s a really middle-class white privilege way of coming at this” Charity Hudley countered when I summarized Rose’s viewpoint for her. “From my point of view for black culture and cultures of people who are lower income and disenfranchised this is the first time you do have a voice in those types of conversations.” Charity Hudley’s point highlights what seems to many to be the bottom line in the conversation around cancel culture: For those who are doing the calling out or the canceling the odds are still stacked against them. They’re still the ones without the social political or professional power to compel someone into meaningful atonement to do much more than organize a collective boycott. “I think that’s why people see [cancel culture] as a threat or furthering the divide” she said. “The divide was already there.” As we head into a new decade that divide seems to be widening and growing more visible. And it isn’t purely a divide between ideologies but also between tactical approaches in navigating those ideological differences and dealing with wrongdoing. The view that a traditional approach — apology atonement and forgiveness — is no longer enough might be startling. But to those who think of cancel culture as an extension of civil rights activists’ push for meaningful change it’s an important tool. And it’s clear that controversial as cancel culture is it is here to stay. Correction: This article originally credited New Jack City screenwriter Thomas Lee Wright with writing the phrase “cancel that bitch.” Co-screenwriter Barry Michael Cooper has claimed credit for writing that scene.

How violent protests against police brutality in the ’60s and ’90s changed public opinion,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/6/2/21275901/police-violence-riots-jacob-blake-kenosha-wisconsin,www.vox.com,1600223579509
As violent protests against police brutality have roiled the country so has a debate over the looting and property damage they have left in their wake. The police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha Wisconsin just months after the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd is the latest tragic demonstration that there’s something wrong with how police operate in the US: massive racial disparities in police killings use of force arrests imprisonment and more. The police reactions to this year’s protests have in many ways validated the message that law enforcement too often operates with impunity with viral videos showing police around the country abusing their authority by attacking demonstrators at random pepper-spraying activists without cause and in one instance ramming their vehicle into protesters. It’s all led to genuine rage against the system which in several cases over the past year has culminated in a minority of protesters burning down buildings and looting businesses. That’s led to a debate about whether breaking windows and setting fires actually advances protesters’ goals or if the violence could backfire moving the public against the protests. A popular sentiment on social media suggests you’re either willing to forgive or overlook the rioting or you’re not really with the protesters. March for Our Lives co-founder Emma González captured the argument in a sarcastic meme earlier this year stating “I can excuse systematic murder but I draw the line at property damage.” A related argument positions riots as a natural necessary part of creating social change. In this view civil rights and police reforms in the 1960s wouldn’t have been possible without the unrest of the ’60s — some of which was violent. I made a version of this argument in 2015 arguing that riots in the ’60s and ’90s ultimately led to necessary changes in policing even if the changes didn’t go far enough. But since then empirical research has come out persuasively showing that riots in the past have not generally swung public opinion toward the causes they’re rooted in. Particularly with the 1960s riots the evidence suggests white voters’ negative reactions to these uprisings in Black communities fueled the rise of “tough-on-crime” politicians whose policies perpetuated some of the problems that protesters in the ’60s stood against and that demonstrators today are now protesting. We don’t know if this research on the 1960s uprisings can be perfectly generalized to protests today when the circumstances political climate and population are different. There are other studies suggesting that at least in limited circumstances riots have helped some causes. But there are concerning signs about the way today’s protests are going. With violence becoming a bigger and bigger part of the news figures like President Donald Trump can ignore the overall message and cause of the protests and instead focus on calling for “law and order” and the deployment of the National Guard. Some like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) have called for military deployment in cities hit by riots. Unrest at protests is producing the very attitudes and positions — from “tough on crime” to the literal militarization of policing — that protesters are standing against. All of this was on full display at the 2020 Republican National Convention which brought up the riots again and again as an example of disorder caused by a Democrat-backed movement. Perhaps in anticipation of this turn some activists have warned against violence. Julia Jackson Jacob Blake’s mother said the “violence doesn’t reflect my son.” Floyd’s brother Terrence in June voiced a similar message to violent protesters: “If I’m not over here messing up my community then what are you all doing? You all are doing nothing. Because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all.” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) who’s sympathetic to the protests argued that the rioters “are not the people who are interested in helping get justice for George Floyd.” Former Vice President Joe Biden the Democratic nominee for president called the violence “needless.” The anger behind the protests and riots is real. But research from the past suggests the path to meaningful change particularly for racial justice is typically more successful through peaceful means. The anger behind the protests is real and justified The video of George Floyd’s death is enraging. There’s no context that can adequately explain a police officer putting his knee on a man’s neck until that man — who repeatedly shouts “I can’t breathe!” — dies. Even other police departments and unions around the US have in an unusual move condemned the way Minneapolis police handled the situation. The video of Jacob Blake’s shooting feels like a repeat of the same kind of tragedy showing an officer repeatedly shooting Blake in the back. Blake is now reportedly paralyzed from the waist down. Floyd’s death was the catalyst for this year’s earlier protests and Blake’s shooting reignited the demonstrations. Both speak to a deeper problem: Police abuse of Black communities is routine in the US. According to the Guardian’s “The Counted” project as of 2016 Black people were more than twice as likely to be killed by police than white people at a respective rate of 6.66 per 1 million people versus 2.9 per 1 million people. The research indicates that this isn’t driven solely by more crime in minority communities but something else — potentially racial bias. One 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found “There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates) meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.” This has been apparent again and again in federal investigation after federal investigation of police departments. The Justice Department’s report on the Baltimore Police Department in 2016 noted when a police shift commander created an arrest form for loitering on public housing; he didn’t even try to hide his racist expectations. In the template there was no space to fill in gender or race. Instead that information was automatically filled out: “Black male.” The report found that Black people in Baltimore were much more likely to be stopped than their white counterparts even after controlling for population. One Black man in his mid-50s was stopped 30 times in less than four years — nearly one stop a month — despite never receiving a citation or criminal charge. “Racially disparate impact is present at every stage of BPD’s enforcement actions from the initial decision to stop individuals on Baltimore streets to searches arrests and uses of force” the report concluded. “These racial disparities along with evidence suggesting intentional discrimination erode the community trust that is critical to effective policing.” This is not something the Justice Department found solely in Baltimore. It appeared again and again: Whether it’s Baltimore Cleveland New Orleans Ferguson Missouri or Chicago the Justice Department has found horrific constitutional violations in how police use force how they target minority residents how they stop and ticket people and just about every other aspect of policing. At the same time police are rarely held accountable for their actions. The National Police Misconduct Reporting Project analyzed 3238 legal actions against police officers accused of misconduct from April 2009 to December 2010. Researcher David Packman who established the project found that only 33 percent were convicted with 36 percent of convicted officers going on to serve prison sentences. Both of those are about half the rate at which members of the public are convicted or incarcerated. This is what’s fueled the demonstrations from the peaceful to the violent. These protests are focused on a real issue — one that has gone neglected in the US even after the rise of Black Lives Matter in 2014. Given this context it should be no surprise that some are turning to violence to express their fury; as Martin Luther King Jr. often said “A riot is the language of the unheard.” Rioting has historically been counterproductive to racial justice causes The best study I’ve seen on the broader national reaction to protests demonstrates that riots in the past backfired. The research isn’t unanimous on this point. A 2019 study by Ryan Enos Aaron Kaufman and Melissa Sands found that the 1992 Los Angeles riot “caused a marked liberal shift in policy support at the polls.” Specifically the riot appeared to mobilize some voters — particularly Black voters — who went on to register Democrat and vote the more liberal position on a slew of local school ballot issues. That indicated the researchers argued that the riots led to a progressive electoral turn. But this study was narrow in scope. It focused on the local effects of one riot and looked specifically at education ballot initiatives. The researchers acknowledged that the reaction may be different for a series of riots: “perhaps while a single riot invokes sympathy a series of riots provokes backlash.” They also noted the overall national response could differ from the local which “could affect the overall efficacy of violent protest.” That’s what other research suggests. A study from Omar Wasow recently published in the American Political Science Review found the national backlash to 1960s riots was fierce — overwhelming support for the cause behind the protests. According to the study peaceful protests for civil rights and against police abuses in the 1960s tended to build support for Democrats who in turn backed the civil rights causes of the time. But support for Democrats decreased after violent protests — and subsequently led to a focus on “law-and-order” style politics. (A note on methodology: For the purposes of this article “violent protest” and “riots” means when protesters became violent. Wasow categorized protests in which demonstrators were peaceful but police or other state actors were not as separate.) We don’t know how riots may have mobilized certain voters. Maybe the violence swayed some genuine swing voters. Maybe riots made it easier for politicians like Nixon to tap into existing racial resentment that enables punitive policies against minority communities. Maybe people who already harbored racist views were more motivated to vote by riots involving Black and brown Americans. There could be something else going on. But the research does suggest an effect. To gauge the political impact of violence in the 1960s Wasow simulated what the 1968 election would have been like if there hadn’t been nearly 140 violent protests immediately following Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination — calculating the shift in voting that would have occurred if there weren’t violent protests in the counties exposed to violence. In more than 7500 of 10000 simulations Democrat Hubert Humphrey a lead author of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 defeated Republican Richard Nixon one of the architects of the modern war on drugs and national “tough-on-crime” politics. It’s impossible to say for certain but that could have prevented some of the exact policing abuses that protesters are now demonstrating against. The 1960s riots did lead to some positive change. The Kerner Commission in 1968 for example reviewed the cause of the uprisings and pushed local police reforms including more active hiring of minority police officers civilian review boards of cases in which police use force and residency requirements forcing police to live in the communities they monitor. “It’s safe to say some changes would have happened a lot more slowly had there not been disruptive protests” Thomas Sugrue a historian at New York University who’s also studied the 1960s riots told me back in 2015. But Sugrue warned: “Riots cut both ways. They do give a voice to the voiceless but they can also lead to consequences that those who are challenging the system don’t intend.” Indeed many of the Kerner Commission’s reforms were ultimately undone or outweighed by the national “tough-on-crime” politics embraced by Nixon followed by President Ronald Reagan and over time doubled down on by other politicians — including some Democrats — who seized on the circumstances and popular sentiment to trumpet the message of “law and order.” The irony today is that the “law-and-order” and “tough-on-crime” politics from back then helped fuel the police abuses leading to the current demonstrations. History might not repeat itself but there’s a big risk We simply don’t know if Wasow’s findings — which come from after all just one study — apply to all riots or the past week’s events. As the Los Angeles riot study suggests the effects of riots may vary at the local level. Maybe a series of riots has a different effect than a single uprising. Perhaps the public will be more sympathetic if there’s for example video evidence of police abuse — as there was in 1992 and there is today. A rapidly diversifying country could also be less sympathetic to police abuses regardless of how such abuses are protested. Maybe Americans will treat Trump as the incumbent differently than Nixon in an open contest. But one of Wasow’s findings seems increasingly relevant to today’s circumstances. Wasow found that “events in which protester-initiated violence occurred irrespective of police response were much more likely to construct frames that played to dominant group biases and invoke language associated with disorder and social control.” To put it another way violence at protests tends to take over the public discussion above the actual cause and message of the demonstrations. This is reflected in the media coverage of the current protests. While much of the attention on social media has gone to police abuses at the demonstrations the media has focused a lot on on protesters’ vandalism and arson — with photos of protesters standing in front of burning wreckage all over TV news after Floyd’s death and now Blake’s shooting. Wasow’s core insight — that faced with at times violent civil rights protests Nixon managed to ride a focus on “law-and-order” to victory — also has eerie relevance today. Under Trump the Justice Department has already abandoned its oversight of police — halting investigations of local departments and reversing reforms implemented by former President Barack Obama’s administration which Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden (who previously took “tough-on-crime” positions) has promised to bring back should he defeat Trump. During the current protests Trump has ignored the overall message of the demonstrations and instead emphasized the need for public safety. In one of many tweets Trump simply wrote “LAW & ORDER!” The bulk of his comments have focused on ending protesters’ violence rather than addressing the cause behind the demonstrations with invocations of the upcoming presidential election. If that works to get Trump reelected the protests almost certainly won’t accomplish the policy changes that many movement leaders want. We don’t know if history will repeat itself but there are signs that it could.

Trump orders federal anti-racism training to be ended, calling it "a sickness",headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/9/5/21423969/trump-federal-antiracism-training-critical-race-theory-white-privilege,www.vox.com,1600223579509
President Donald Trump directed federal agencies Friday to end diversity training programs calling them on Saturday “a sickness that cannot be allowed to continue.” Trump’s decision to eliminate the anti-racism training — featuring “critical race theory” and discussions of “white privilege” according to the directive — comes amid a nationwide reckoning on racial injustice the president has firmly opposed. The change was announced in a memo sent to the heads of federal agencies from Russell Vought director of the Office of Management and Budget. Vought wrote that Trump ordered the sessions canceled after learning federal agencies are spending millions of dollars training employees in “divisive anti-American propaganda.” Those trainings taught workers that “virtually all White people contribute to racism” or benefit from it the memo claims adding that some of the trainings have stated there is “racism embedded in the belief that America is the land of opportunity or the belief that the most qualified person should receive a job.” These teachings “engender division and resentment” within the federal workforce and contradict the “fundamental beliefs” of the nation Vought claimed adding that is why Trump has asked him to stop “these divisive un-American propaganda training sessions.” The memo repeatedly cites “press reports” as having illuminated the substance of the trainings. While it doesn’t identify what those reports are a New York Post opinion piece on the subject was published Tuesday and picked up by Fox News which the president watches almost religiously. Agencies have been told to begin identifying trainings related to critical race theory or white privilege as well as any training that suggests the US is “an inherently racist or evil country” or “that any race or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil” and to investigate ways to end their contracts with those providing the instruction. Following reporting on the memo Vought tweeted “the days of taxpayer funded indoctrination trainings that sow division and racism are over.” Trump too celebrated the decision on Twitter highlighting the positive reactions of some supporters through retweets and by asking people to “report any sightings” of the trainings “so we can quickly extinguish!” The decision is particularly salient given that it comes amid one of the largest civil rights movements in American history which has seen ongoing anti-racism protests that have sparked conversations about racial inequities in a number of industries. Critical race theory aims to examine the systemic racism people are currently protesting Trump’s decision seeks to root out trainings on critical race theory framing it as an insidious idea that conceptualizes white people and institutions as inherently racist. This is not accurate however. Critical race theory is a school of thought that examines how race and racism is perpetuated through existing legal and cultural systems. It supposes that examining and critiquing social institutions — and creating spaces for people of color to share their experiences — can help create a fairer world. Examining the advantages white people enjoy in social economic and political areas (also known as white privilege) is a part of understanding and challenging those systems. But the Trump administration has long pushed back on that concept which has been thrown into the spotlight as the US grapples with racial fault lines exposed by the coronavirus pandemic — which has disproportionately killed people of color — and continued shootings of Black people by police. Trump has said the Black Lives Matter movement is a “symbol of hate” and has called those protesting police brutality “thugs.” He’s threatened to end protests by sending US troops into American cities saying ongoing anti-racism protests amount to “domestic terror.” Throughout his presidency Trump has vehemently opposed protesters’ and officials’ efforts to take down Confederate statues and has begun to promote a “law and order” campaign message that has included a racist dog whistle pledge to protect “suburban housewives” from “inner city” crime. And the president has consistently declined to condemn brazenly racist comments or actions. For instance when a supporter in a retirement community was filmed shouting “white power” while driving a golf cart bedecked with Trump memorabilia in June he retweeted it. Amid the pandemic he’s called the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” and the “kung flu” which his critics say has been connected to an increase in racist slurs and jokes against Asian Americans. He’s recently resurfaced birther conspiracy theories against Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris that echo the lies he repeatedly spread about former President Barack Obama. The American public has responded in kind. Around half of Americans say the president has made race relations in the country worse since he took office according to a Pew study — a number that has remained fairly steady since the start of Trump’s tenure. And Pew has also found confusion as well as a deep partisan divide over what the ongoing anti-racism protests are about. Despite Vought claiming otherwise it is these sorts of divisions that diversity trainings — including those that feature critical race theory — are meant to bridge.

Race, policing, and the universal yearning for safety,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/9/15/21437156/police-racial-bias-shootings-the-ezra-klein-show,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Our conversation over race and policing — like our conversations over virtually everything in America — is shot through with a crude individualism. Talking in terms of systems and contexts comes less naturally to us but that means we often miss the true story. Phillip Atiba Goff is the co-founder and CEO of the Center for Policing Equity as well as a professor of African American studies and psychology at Yale University. At CPE Goff sits atop the world’s largest collection of police behavioral data. So he has the evidence and he knows what it tells us — and just as importantly what it doesn’t even attempt to measure. He knows what we can say with confidence about race and policing and what we wish we knew but simply don’t. He thinks in systems in contexts in uncertainty — in the bigger harder picture. That’s what this conversation on The Ezra Klein Show is about. What do we know about racial bias in policing? At what levels does it operate? Where has it been measured and what haven’t we even tried to measure? How much of policing is driven by crime rates? How do we think about the conditions that create crime in this analysis and what do we miss when we ignore them? What do we know about the investments that actually make people safe? How do we balance the reality that police do help reduce violent crime with the fury communities have at being overpoliced or victimized by police? How do we experiment with other models of safety carefully and systematically? There’s a lot in this one. This conversation could’ve gone for hours longer. But these are tough issues and they deserve someone who understands both the micro-level data and the macro-level context. Goff does and he shares that knowledge generously and clearly here. An edited excerpt from our conversation follows. The full conversation can be heard on The Ezra Klein Show.

Ezra Klein You recently said that “the way we set up law enforcement is almost the exact way we’d set up an experiment to make you engage in more discriminatory behavior.” Can you talk about why that is? Phillip Atiba Goff Social psychologists at least for the last quarter-century have been making our research smaller and smaller and smaller to make it more and more precise. What that allows us to do is to get the exact situations that are most likely to get everyday people to engage in discriminatory behavior. Things like: I’m tired. If you’re tired your brain gets lazy and you overrely on overlearned associations. So you end up behaving in line with stereotypes. If you’re multitasking if you’re cognitively depleted if your adrenaline is off if you’re in a new situation if you’re being negatively stereotyped because of your membership within a visible group that matters to you — all of those things are really robust predictors [of discriminatory behavior]. You can manipulate them in a laboratory and you will get people to discriminate against Black folks and not white folks across a whole host of different dimensions. But also all of those things are literally the job description for law enforcement. So it is not surprising that we see some pretty significant racial disparities on the other side. It’s exactly what we would predict. In fact most social psychologists would consider that to be cheating. You just added all the things you knew were going to produce bias and you put them all together. Except it’s not an experiment — it’s with people’s lives. Ezra Klein There is an argument on the right from people like Heather Mac Donald that there’s no racial bias in policing despite what the headline statistics say. And often they cite work like the Roland Fryer study from a few years back. Can you give me your gloss on that? How do we know if there is racial bias in policing? And what can we say about where it does or doesn’t show up? Phillip Atiba Goff There is nobody — and I mean nobody — I’ve met who is remotely serious who has the skills to evaluate research who’s looked at actual data who says there’s no racial bias in policing. That’s just not a serious position. That’s like saying there’s no oxygen on Earth and there’s no such thing as the color green. Of course there’s bias in policing. Where there could be a reasonable debate is at what level and at what magnitude. Those are serious questions to which we have the beginnings of some answers. Roland Fryer for all of the things that I think are irresponsible in the way he has written up some of his stuff on policing does not contend that there is no bias in policing. In fact in the first article that he put out — the one that got all the unnecessary undue attention — it was really clear there are loads of racial disparities which probably constitute bias in police use of force. For whatever reason he decided to emphasize that he didn’t see it in use of deadly force. But in every other form of use of force he finds it. So we have to set the table stakes here. No serious person is claiming there’s no racial bias. The people who are claiming that are politically motivated — they’re not really set up to evaluate the science and they’re not interested evaluating the science. There’s not controversy there. If we’re gonna go to where there’s some unanswered questions we should be asking: What are the outcomes where we see bias? Where do we have good evidence and not good evidence? And what are the levels at which bias might exist? Ezra Klein You say the way to think about this is that it operates at three levels. What are those three levels? Phillip Atiba Goff First let me talk about the overall outcomes. When people are talking about use of deadly force that’s a really small percentage of an already small percentage of incidents and small numbers work differently statistically. So I could look at use of force generally and we see incontrovertible evidence of not just disparities but bias. If I look at vehicle stops and pedestrian stops if I look at ticketing and arrests those are biased even when benchmarked against the most conservative benchmarks of crime. Other outcomes might not look biased depending on how you analyze them. But the levels are what we really should be talking about. Police bias works on three levels. First an individual officer may or may not be biased may or may not exhibit bias. If an officer treats Black people one way and white people another way — if they treat Latinos white people and Asian people differently — that’s at the level of the encounter. If you send Black people and white people out under the same circumstances to encounter the police how do they come back? It’s definitely the case that we see bias there but if we restrict our conversations to just biased officers we’re missing the other two levels. The second level is probably the most important one: the level of community. Let’s say I’m a robot officer so I treat everybody I come in contact with exactly the same but I am deployed differently to Black neighborhoods than white neighborhoods. You’re still gonna see racial disparities. That is a form of bias that afflicts Black communities and poor communities tremendously but it’s not going to look like the individual officers are biased. The decision-making and the deployment patterns are biased. And we must be able to hold that to account because policing is fundamentally a neighborhood issue even more than it’s an encounter issue. Ezra Klein When you say deploy differently what do you mean by deployment? Phillip Atiba Goff It could mean a number of different things. So one thing is in these neighborhoods over here you’re going to deploy stop question and frisk. That’s one way. But it also could just be: I want 20 officers per square block right per block over in this neighborhood and one officer per 20 blocks in this other neighborhood. Just the concentration of officers is going to lead to different outcomes. It could also be something like: Everywhere across the city where you see an open-air drug market I want you arresting folks. Now I don’t know when the last time was that you were on a college campus but most college drug use happens in dormitories. It’s an indoor drug market. And even if it weren’t we don’t treat colleges in the same kinds of ways that we treat low-income Black and brown communities. So the same instruction for an officer to bust open-air drug markets is going to afflict some communities different than others just because of the geographic-spatial elements of those communities. That’s the community level at which bias can operate. The last one which I think is harder to conceptualize is the city level. Let’s say everybody in Philadelphia is getting treated the same at the encounter level and every neighborhood in Philadelphia is treated exactly the same. But let’s say across the board Philadelphia cops treat folks more harshly than cops in a city like Bridgeport Connecticut. It’s actually not that hard to imagine. But because percentage-wise there’s more Black people in Philadelphia than Bridgeport you see racial disparities. That’s also potentially a source of bias: We have a different function — literally a different mission — for law enforcement in cities that are a higher percentage of Black and brown than we have in cities that are a higher percentage white. We’ve got to be able to understand each of those levels. Ezra Klein I want to go through some of the objections here. The thing you hear next in this discussion is that this is all generated by crime rates: Officers police more aggressively where there’s more crime and there’s more crime in Black communities. So everything you see here is simply a function of police going where the crime is. What is the relationship between the crime rate of a local community and police violence? Phillip Atiba Goff Before I respond let me just point out that this is the more reasoned version of the question. What you usually hear is “What about Black-on-Black crime?” And the other version of it that is more popular recently is “But what about Chicago?” It’s important to distinguish between the two forms of that question which are good faith and bad faith. The bad-faith version of that question is: Come on you know Black people just deserve it. It’s almost expressly bigoted and it should be treated as such. The bad-faith version so proliferates that people should understand why folks have such a strong and emotional reaction to that form of the question — because it’s meant to indicate that Black people deserve what’s happening to them. But there is another form of it the good-faith version which is: What cops do is go where crime goes and if there is more crime in Black communities which some statistics show shouldn’t we expect that that’s a portion of it? That you have to deal with that seriously. If you don’t deal with that seriously you haven’t been careful in your methodologies. But that’s a solvable empirical question. You can answer that by looking and seeing every piece of the best research from the work done by Andrew Gelman and Jeff Fagan to the work that we did with the Urban Institute to the theoretical models of Cody Ross and John Mummolo and Dean Knox. Every one of them says crime is a big predictor of police deployment and police contact. So is poverty by the way — not that that makes it okay. So poverty and crime are big predictors but in all the cities we’ve ever looked at they aren’t sufficient to explain the racial disparities. Crime and poverty matter but there are still disparities after that. There’s evidence that there’s still bias after that. In some cities crime and poverty predict about 80 percent of the disparity; in other cities crime and poverty rates are about 20 percent. And that means there’s a real difference in how much police behavior and policy is a driver of inequality in policing and therefore in criminal justice outcomes. That’s where the educated conversation in the country should be but we’re nowhere near that. Ezra Klein I’m glad you brought in poverty here because I want to add in what potentially seems to me to be a fourth level though it might be embedded in one of the ones you offered. All the methodology operates once a crime has occurred more or less. But there’s this whole other question of what creates crime itself and what creates criminogenic conditions. We know a bunch about this: Poverty creates crime. Not having health insurance creates crime — you cut crime if you expand Medicaid in different areas. One of the things that has happened in America is that we have used policy — redlining and segregation and disinvestment and job discrimination and more — to create much more criminogenic conditions in Black communities. The outcome of that has been more crime and then we aggressively police those communities in response. We tend to see crime as an individual decision and to some degree it is but we also have good evidence that crime is a social and policy outcome. That seems like another way structural racism shows up in this conversation that can be very hard to track and does not show up in a lot of the studies. Phillip Atiba Goff That’s exactly right. What we choose to make a crime is deeply influenced by the racial legacies of the United States and the ways in which we create conditions for crime are deeply racially biased. So even if you are benchmarking crime what you’re benchmarking is an endogenous variable. So even the things that we find are pretty aggressively conservative estimates of the level of bias that we see out there exactly for that reason: Racial bias is already baked into what we’ve defined as how we’re policing various crimes. The crack versus powder cocaine disparities is the quintessential example. But there’s literally tens of thousands of smaller and bigger examples throughout the codes of different states and different cities. One of the big problems that we had when we first started doing this work at the Center for Policing Equity was just this — they called it the problem of the benchmark or the denominator problem. If a police department beats up Black people four times more often than it beats up white people that’s clearly a problem. But nobody knows how much of that problem is the fault of police as opposed to how much is inequality or discrimination in housing and health care and employment and education. It’s not erasing racism to acknowledge that there are upstream factors that afflict Black communities that are also racist. But our conversations about policing have been so narrow — because our understandings around public safety have been so narrow — that we have erased all the upstream factors that end up showing up as outcomes when we’re talking about policing.

"The Latino vote is not being taken seriously": Ex-Bernie Sanders adviser sounds an alarm,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/9/9/21420401/latino-vote-democrats-joe-biden-chuck-rocha,www.vox.com,1600223579509
In recent months one consistent weak spot in former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential polls has been with Latino voters. Hillary Clinton won an estimated 66 percent of those voters in 2016. Biden appears to be earning between 45 percent and 64 percent of Latino support nationally. In Florida Biden’s lead among Latinos is substantially slimmer than Clinton’s results in 2016 exit polls (11 percentage points off Clinton in a recent poll) which could become the difference between winning or losing a swing state that backed Trump in the last election. Latinos are the largest contingent of nonwhite voters in America. And Chuck Rocha a senior adviser on Sen. Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign is worried that Democrats are taking them for granted in 2020. Rocha was the architect of an outreach effort — described in his new book Tío Bernie — that helped Sanders secure the most votes among Latinos during the Nevada Texas and California primaries. (Biden had the edge in Florida.) Under Rocha’s leadership the campaign showed up in Latino communities early and often investing heavily in spreading Sanders’s message in Spanish and English. He set up offices everywhere from the heavily Latino area of East Las Vegas to Texas border districts that have long been neglected by politicians at the state and national level due to historically low rates of voter engagement. And he hired Latino staff from the grassroots advocacy community and integrated them into every facet of the campaign. In Texas that strategy took Sanders from winning 28 percent of Latinos in 2016 to 41 percent of Latinos in 2020 according to entrance and exit polls. Winning the general election is a different game. Roughly half of registered Hispanic voters identify as Democrats and about one-quarter identify as Republicans. Biden who has tried to portray himself as a moderate might be better positioned than Sanders was to pick up votes among independent and Republican Latino voters. But Rocha is still concerned that Biden is underperforming due to a lack of investment in Latino outreach. The Biden campaign appears to be investing more heavily in Latino outreach in recent weeks but outside donors and PACs — apart from Rocha’s Nuestro PAC — aren’t yet following suit. In a conversation Rocha and I discussed Latino voters Biden and down-ballot Democrats; why Trump might be gaining ground with Latinos; and where Biden should be targeting his outreach efforts. Here’s a transcript of our conversation lightly edited for length and clarity. Nicole Narea Why do you think the Sanders campaign was so successful in capturing the Latino vote in key states like Nevada California and Texas? Chuck Rocha We started early and we hired lots of Latino staff and consultants. There was no Latino department. We made Latinos an integral part of the overall campaign instead of siloing them off into departments with no power and no influence over the campaign. So there were influential Latinos at every level of the campaign. Nicole Narea You’ve been urging the Biden campaign to replicate that strategy. But in your view has the campaign and the Democratic Party more broadly been doing enough to engage Latino voters? Have they leaned on the model that you created at all? Chuck Rocha The Biden campaign got a late start because of the coronavirus. They just started really doing aggressive Spanish-language and Latino-focused outreach through paid communications. They may not spend as much money in the general election as I did in the primary which is disappointing. I spent $15 million in the primary and I only did it in four states. But the Biden campaign currently is not my biggest worry. They have shown that they’re going to spend money to talk to Latinos. And I hope that they are targeting infrequent and newly registered Latinos like we did with Bernie. He doesn’t have to take people as far as I had to take Bernie. Joe Biden already has 50 percent of Latinos in every state. He needs to get that to 70 percent to be the next president. So you can still move Latinos 10 or 15 points in 60 days but you have to spend a lot of money to do that. Nicole Narea So what is your biggest worry? Chuck Rocha It’s the outside outreach game that’s currently keeping me up at night: I’m currently tracking over a half a billion dollars that had been given to outside super PACs to boost Joe Biden in the presidential election and less than 1 percent of all of that money went to Latino super PACs. Currently I’ve spent more money talking to Latinos than any other Latino super PAC in America — and that’s currently at just under $4 million. If my PAC is the biggest and has spent the most money talking to Latinos all summer and I’ve only raised and spent $4 million it shows you the disparity. It seems like the Latino vote is not being taken seriously by activists around the country because again even after I proved that it’s possible for us to get out if we’re funded — and I literally wrote a book about it — Latino organizations are still not being funded to get out the vote and to maximize our input. Why are we spending 99 cents of every dollar on white suburban voters and not on Black or brown voters? Joe Biden needs to win suburban white people. But he also has to have African Americans turn out at the same rate that we did in ’08 and have Latino percentages of support be the same as they were for Barack Obama. I see the investment going into [the] white suburban vote and I do not see the investment in outside support to get the Black and brown vote up. Nicole Narea Do you think that leaves an opening for Trump and the Republican Party to try to make a play for Latinos? Chuck Rocha Up until August 1 Donald Trump had spent three times as much money on Spanish-language communication as Joe Biden. Joe Biden has caught up with that spending and it’s equal now but he’s done it all in the last two weeks. He’s made huge buys. That tells me they’re not doing as well as they can. Donald Trump got ahead of him defined who he was and they had to really ramp up their Spanish-language spending outspending Donald Trump by 10 to one in the last two weeks trying to catch up. I’ve been doing focus groups and polling all summer with my leadership PAC which is called Nuestro PAC. And we’ve known all along that Latino men were a soft spot. They just weren’t as convinced [as women] about Joe Biden. Some of this “law and order” stuff about having safe streets for your kids and your family works with Latino men. Not a majority of them. Not even 30 percent. But he only needs to skim off 4 or 5 percent of Latino men and it changes the entire electorate. Nicole Narea You mentioned that newly registered Latino voters are a group that you targeted specifically. Are there any other kind of demographic subgroups where there could be particular growth opportunity for Democrats? Chuck Rocha There are 138000 new registered Latinos in Arizona alone and if [Biden] was to get half of them to vote for him this election would be over. There’s what we call “infrequent Latino voters” — Latinos who have registered to vote because somebody registered them at a grocery store or at some other place and they’ve never really voted. Maybe an election here or there [but] they’ve just never really been involved. They have been so impacted by Covid and so impacted by the Donald Trump presidency with his racial rhetoric that’s affected them in ways that they hadn’t seen before. So I think there’s an opportunity to engage them. And then third would be newly naturalized citizens. But Trump has used Covid as an excuse not to [naturalize people] unless it’s for lonesome souls who didn’t know they were going to be on camera that he uses as puppets at his convention. Nicole Narea Are there other states besides Arizona where you see Latinos tipping the scales? Chuck Rocha What’s underreported right [now] is the problem in Nevada. It worries me that the donor class and the consultant class think that Nevada is a safe blue state but what they don’t realize — because they haven’t been there in a while and they don’t know the Latino community like I know it in Nevada where Bernie Sanders got 73 percent of support amongst Latinos — is that the entire Culinary Union is laid off. The entire [Las Vegas] strip is shut down for the most part. So there’s astronomical unemployment there. Normally you have a robust infrastructure going on there lots of money being spent. The Culinary Union spends a gazillion dollars putting all their people in the streets and then the neighborhoods getting Latinos out to vote. That’s how [former Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid did it back in the day. Nicole Narea But none of that’s happening? Chuck Rocha Yeah. And so that worries me. I’ve been seeing some inside polls that say it’s much closer than people think it is. Nicole Narea We’ve been mostly talking about the presidential election but do you also see Latinos making a big difference in down-ballot races in any particular parts of the country? Chuck Rocha I worry that the lack of investment in the Latino turnout operation is going to make some of these targeted congressional seats really problematic for Democrats to hold. Because all of the money for this type of work is just going into white voters in Pennsylvania and white voters in North Carolina I worry about democratically held Latino seats that are going to be tough to hold — like Xochitl Torres Small in southern New Mexico and Gil Cisneros in Orange County California. There’s nothing going on in California in the general election; there’s nobody spending money getting people out to vote. They’re in California for god’s sake. And I worry about the lack of investment in Latinos in a district like Florida’s [26th Congressional District] the district from Miami to Key West which is Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. If they’re not turning Latinos out there she’s gonna have a hard time running against a popular Miami County mayor in that seat. So yes it’s going to have huge impact.

Trump’s criminal justice policy, explained,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020-presidential-election/21418911/donald-trump-crime-criminal-justice-policy-record,www.vox.com,1600223579509
President Donald Trump is trying to refashion his 2020 presidential campaign into a 1980s-style “tough on crime” platform. He’s now tweeted “LAW & ORDER!” with no context more than a dozen times. He’s gone to Kenosha Wisconsin the site of recent protests and riots after the police shooting of Jacob Blake only to deflect questions about whether systemic racism is real argue that people “want the police to be police” and condemn “dangerous anti-police rhetoric.” It’s a gamble that seeks to mask Trump’s failures on Covid-19. But if it works to get Trump reelected it could damage or reverse efforts to reform America’s criminal justice system — even as people continue to march in the streets against police brutality mass incarceration and the systemic racism enshrined in both. Trump has promoted “tough on crime” policies not just since his run for president in 2015 and 2016 but in the decades before. In 1989 Trump ran a local ad calling for the death penalty for the “Central Park Five” who were falsely accused of attacking and raping a jogger in New York City. In 2000 Trump claimed in his book The America We Deserve “Tough crime policies are the most important form of national defense.” He also stated “Clearly we don’t have too many people in prison. Quite the contrary.” On the campaign trail last time around Trump in 2015 argued that “we have to get a lot tougher” on crime. In 2017 he advocated for police being rougher during arrests claiming he’s told cops “Please don’t be too nice.” Trump’s administration has subsequently ended investigations into local and state police departments accused of misconduct arguing that cops shouldn’t be shackled by the federal government. It has encouraged federal prosecutors to pursue the harshest possible sentences including more punitive punishments for lower-level offenses and the death penalty for drug crimes. And it has restarted federal executions. Trump’s second-term agenda makes zero mention of any kind of criminal justice reform whether for incarceration or policing. Instead one section titled “DEFEND OUR POLICE” promises more police officers stricter penalties for assaults on cops prosecuting drive-by shootings as domestic terrorism going after “Violent Extremist Groups Like ANTIFA” and reversing reforms to end cash bail. As he runs for that second term Trump has occasionally touted outliers in his record. Trump did sign criminal justice reform the First Step Act into law. He commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson who previously received a life sentence for her role in a cocaine trafficking ring and later pardoned her. These appear to be contradictions but in context they seem more like the result of personal favors: The First Step Act was pushed by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Johnson’s commutation by celebrity Kim Kardashian. “I view that [the First Step Act] as just the outlier on what would otherwise be a truly abysmal record on criminal justice issues” Rachel Barkow a criminal justice expert at New York University told me. There’s a racial element to all of this. When literal neo-Nazis and KKK members march in Charlottesville Virginia and one of them murders a counter-protester “law and order” suddenly became “very fine people on both sides.” When a white 17-year-old is charged with murder for killing two people at a Black Lives Matter protest Trump goes from shouting about chaos and lawlessness in major cities to actually defending a specific act of violence classified as a crime. As was true from the 1970s to the ’90s “tough on crime” seems geared toward targeting a specific segment of the population with what’s euphemistically called “law and order” more than following a literal interpretation of these phrases. The social or policy outcomes may not matter to Trump. His main goal is to get reelected and he will say and do anything he thinks will work toward that goal. A message of “law and order” is meant to appeal to a base with racist views about crime and minority communities — as it has in the past — while maybe grabbing some voters who are genuinely concerned about murders riots and disorder in American cities. If that message contradicts Trump’s support of the First Step Act or Alice Johnson his campaign doesn’t seem to care especially if they can still use the First Step Act and Johnson’s commutation to draw minority voters and reassure Trump-skeptical Republicans. Still there are possible policy repercussions. Trump has promised to double down on the same “tough on crime” policies that he and his administration have tried to carry out in his first term. If that happens those policies will based on the evidence do little to stop and reduce crime — but could continue to as such policies have for decades enable aggressive policing in minority communities and maintain America’s status as the world’s leader in incarceration. And if Trump wins by doubling down on a “law and order” platform — if that’s enough to get swing voters behind him after failing so disastrously on the Covid-19 pandemic — that also could send a message to other lawmakers that “tough on crime” politics and policy are still potent. That could get more politicians at the local state and federal level on board with such an approach. It would amount to a huge blow to current protests and reform efforts. Trump’s approach is stuck in the 1980s “tough on crime” days Trump has never tried to hide his views on crime and criminal justice. In 2015 he simply described himself as “tough on crime.” In a preview of the rhetoric that he’s continued to use in office he said “You look at what’s going on in the inner cities right now it’s unbelievable. … It’s like the Wild West.” (In 2014 the homicide rate actually hit a historic low.) When later asked how exactly he would fix crime in these cities Trump called for “tough police tactics.” “By being very much tougher than they are right now” Trump said. “They’re right now not tough. I could tell you this very long and quite boring story. But when I was in Chicago I got to meet a couple of very top police. I said ‘How do you stop this? How do you stop this? If you were put in charge — to a specific person — do you think you could stop it?’ He said ‘Mr. Trump I’d be able to stop it in one week.’ And I believed him 100 percent.” Trump added “He wants to use tough police tactics which is okay when you have people being killed.” Trump’s administration acted on this. Under President Barack Obama the US Department of Justice had initiated a historic number of investigations into local and police departments — uncovering abuse after abuse failure after failure. Trump’s attorney general at the time Jeff Sessions halted these investigations arguing that the Justice Department will not take part in “handcuffing the police instead of criminals.” Going “tough” has continued to be Trump’s response to just about anything related to crime. In response to the opioid epidemic for example Trump called for and Sessions signed off on the death penalty for people “dealing in extremely large quantities of drugs.” Trump also signed various crime-related executive orders including a series signaling support for “tough on crime” policies and an order that called for harsher prison sentences for people who deface statues (in response to people vandalizing statues during the debate about Confederate figures). He’s also sent federal law enforcement to harass and arrest Black Lives Matter protesters — most notably in Portland Oregon although he’s pushed for separate different deployments in other cities as part of his broader efforts to escalate policing in response to violence. As the saying goes personnel is policy too. Trump backed “tough on crime” policies on the campaign trail then nominated Sessions with his long history of calling for similar policies as attorney general — and Sessions delivered repeatedly pulling back efforts by the Obama administration to make the criminal justice system less punitive. After Sessions left the post Trump replaced him with Bill Barr who as attorney general for President George H.W. Bush in 1992 published a report titled The Case for More Incarceration. On the 2020 campaign trail Trump has continued talking up his support of the “tough on crime” approach. He’s argued that “Democrat run cities are now rampant with crime” and only he and his “tough” approach can fix it. Vice President Mike Pence made this explicit in his Republican convention speech when he said in reference to the Democratic nominee for president “The hard truth is you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.” Both candidates have gone to great lengths to suggest that Democrats are “soft” on crime leading to more murders in big cities (ignoring that murder rates have also soared in Republican-run cities). There’s nothing new about this; it’s the same playbook that politicians — of both parties — used in the 1980s and ’90s as violent crime rose and they fell under increasing pressure to do something about it. That included Democrats: Biden then a senator went on national TV in 1989 to criticize President George H.W. Bush’s anti-crime plan for not including “enough police officers to catch the violent thugs not enough prosecutors to convict them not enough judges to sentence them and not enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.” Since the 1980s and ’90s empirical evidence has shown that “tough on crime” policies for incarceration and policing aren’t effective. This fact combined with the high costs of such approaches (incarcerating nearly 1 percent of the population is expensive) led Democrats and Republicans to work on criminal justice reform particularly as local and state budgets were strained by the Great Recession between 2007 and 2009. But not Trump. “He is a dinosaur in every sense of the word” Barkow said. “He has shown no evolution on any of these issues.” These appeals to law and order were always intertwined with racism. When local news outlets talked about crime and disorder especially in US cities the stories often focused on Black and brown people. The war on drugs mass incarceration and aggressive policing disproportionately hit Black and brown communities. Under presidents like Richard Nixon Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton “tough on crime” messages of “law and order” turned into dog whistles for controlling people of color. “The phrasing that he uses — saying ‘silent majority’ saying ‘law and order’ — those are catchphrases from a different era with particular meanings that he knows and he’s using them deliberately” Barkow said of Trump. Trump is no stranger to racism and dog whistles. The first time he appeared in the New York Times in 1973 the Justice Department had sued him for racial discrimination in housing. Trump rose to political prominence after Obama’s 2008 election by promoting racist birther conspiracy theories about the country’s first Black president. He’s continuing his appeals to his predominantly white base with similar messaging about crime and chaos in cities largely populated by minority groups — and that electioneering may be his main goal more than any particular policy change. The First Step Act is an outlier but it says little about Trump There are two big outliers in Trump’s “tough on crime” history: The First Step Act and the commutation and pardon of Alice Johnson. The First Step Act was genuine criminal justice reform pulling back some harsh prison sentences and giving more federal inmates a way to earn an early release. A recent report by the US Sentencing Commission found it let thousands of people get shorter sentences and allowed some of them to get out of prison early. The law was almost wholly the work of Congress including both Democratic and Republican legislators. It was in large part a continuation of criminal justice reform efforts that began during Obama’s second term so much of the law preceded Trump entirely. But after Trump signed it he’s taken more and more of the credit for it. The law is also limited only affecting a fraction of federal inmates (and only about 12 percent of people in prison in the US are held at the federal level). That’s why its name is clear that it’s meant to be a first step. (Trump once proposed a Second Step Act that was even more limited seeking only to ease barriers to employment for people released from prison but it hasn’t been mentioned in his 2020 campaign or as part of his platform.) There is nothing about Trump’s record that suggests he wants to reform prison sentences and release people from prison early. He’s said the opposite: In 2016 he criticized Obama for “releasing violent criminals from the jails including drug dealers and those with gun crimes. And they’re being let go by the thousands. By the thousands.” “I think he saw [the First Step Act] as a politically convenient move — perhaps to pick up some Black and Hispanic supporters” John Pfaff a criminal justice expert at Fordham University told me. “But it wasn’t much.” He added “His current posturing about ‘law and order’ and everything tied in that phrase is where his true underlying values have always been and remain.” Trump’s support for the First Step Act seems to be a result of heavy lobbying for the law by his son-in-law whose dad went to prison. Kushner reportedly convinced Trump to go along with the law by appealing to the president’s ego — pointing out criminal justice reform is a thing Obama couldn’t do but Trump could. In the aftermath Trump’s Justice Department has at various times resisted or slow-walked the implementation of the First Step Act — with federal prosecutors for example actively resisting the release of some inmates who qualify under the law. Meanwhile the commutation and pardon of Alice Johnson was not so much a policy act as it was a favor for a celebrity. Trump agreed to the commutation only after Kim Kardashian met with him at the White House imploring Trump to use his pardon powers to grant relief to Johnson. Trump listened commuting Johnson’s life sentence for a nonviolent drug crime so she could get out of prison early. Trump is no stranger to using his presidential powers to help out his friends and allies. He pardoned political ally and former Maricopa County Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio commuted adviser Roger Stone’s sentence and discussed pardoning former national security adviser Michael Flynn. If Trump genuinely cared about criminal justice reform this isn’t how he would handle pardons and commutations. Obama for example set up a broad program to give pardons and commutations to people caught under punitive “tough on crime” laws — and that led to Obama setting a record in cutting prisoners’ sentences. Experts and Democratic politicians have called for setting up a clemency board to relax people’s prison sentences without an act of Congress. But Trump has actively criticized such approaches complaining that they allowed Obama to let thousands of inmates free. It’s of course possible to have moderate or mixed views on criminal justice issues. Some people for example support reforming the police and reducing incarceration but argue that more aggressive measures like defunding or abolishing the police go too far. And it’s possible to simply have changed your mind on criminal justice issues as the evidence and US’s experience show “tough on crime” policies don’t work. Both of these examples match Biden’s stated views as he runs for president. But there’s simply no indication that this is true for Trump. He supported the First Step Act but has called for and through his Justice Department enabled harsher sentences and more aggressive policing. He commuted Johnson’s life sentence for her involvement in a cocaine trafficking ring but has called for the death penalty for drug traffickers and dealers and criticized Obama for using the same pardon powers to release people in similar situations to Johnson’s. These are just contradictions. Trump’s reelection could have big repercussions for crime politics and policy For much of Trump’s first term his “tough on crime” views didn’t seem to play a big role in the day-to-day work of the criminal justice system. That was in part a reflection of how the US criminal justice system works: It’s actually the local and state governments not the feds that oversee the vast majority of policing and incarceration with about 88 percent of prison inmates held in state facilities and the vast majority of the 18000 or so police departments in the US run at the local or state level. Even under Trump the federal prison population fell from nearly 186000 in 2017 to less than 156000 today. Then Minneapolis police officers killed George Floyd setting off Black Lives Matter protests looting and riots across the country. That was followed by a rise in murders in big US cities and renewed demonstrations and unrest following the Kenosha Wisconsin police shooting of Jacob Blake. So Trump ramped up his “tough on crime” rhetoric characterized by his “LAW & ORDER!” tweets — changing the subject from his botched handling of the Covid-19 pandemic which led to a resurgence in cases and deaths in the US unlike what most other developed nations have seen. His rhetorical focus could have an impact. The president doesn’t have much legislative sway on a lot of criminal justice issues with previous attempts at encouraging states to embrace certain policies in this space such as Biden’s punitive 1994 crime law falling short. But the bully pulpit experts say can play a powerful role signaling not just to the general public but to other lawmakers and the police what’s within the realm of the acceptable. As Pfaff who’s deeply skeptical of federal impact over criminal justice issues told me “The president’s biggest power is his bully pulpit.” Maybe the actual impact doesn’t matter to Trump. Maybe he doesn't care if there are no major policy changes at any level regarding criminal justice. Maybe he doesn’t actually care if the federal prison population drops or rises under his watch. Maybe all that matters to him is he says and does the kinds of things that persuade enough of his base and swing voters to lead him to victory in November. Courtney Parella a spokesperson for the Trump campaign responded in a statement: “On one hand you have Joe Biden’s who was as an architect of mass incarceration which unfairly and disproportionally impacted minority communities on the other hand you have President Trump who has worked to fix Biden’s failures and is reforming America’s criminal justice system to help restore peace and security across the nation. The choice could not be more clear President Trump is the only person in this race who will continue to advocate for fairness in our justice system and safety in our communities.” Still a Trump victory would send a message through the US and its criminal justice system. It would signal that swing voters are okay with the excesses of the current system and reject the protests of the past year. It would come off as an endorsement of Trump’s own “tough on crime” approach. Some experts and observers also worry that if Trump wins his victory would demonstrate that a platform of “law and order” and “tough on crime” still works. It’s speculative but there’s an intuitive sense to the idea: By winning Trump would show not only that such a platform is effective enough to win the White House but effective enough to distract from a historic botched federal response to a pandemic that’s now killed more than 189000 Americans and caused the economy to collapse. “These are tried-and-true strategies some people thought had died” Barkow said. “But if [Trump] succeeds running a campaign like this people will double down and do more of it.” So far the gamble doesn’t seem to be working. Trump is behind 7 points in national polling averages and 3 points in polling averages for top battleground states including Wisconsin. But if it does work it could damage the loose bipartisan coalition that has come together for criminal justice reform over the past few years. That could translate not just to federal action but local and state changes as well. And after four years in which Trump’s “tough on crime” views didn’t amount to much policy change nationwide the ideas that he’s pushed for decades could come back to the mainstream in a big way.

Kenosha’s looting is a symptom of a decrepit democracy,headline,https://www.vox.com/21405407/kenosha-protests-looting-biden-trump-jacob-blake,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made a forceful denunciation this week of the property destruction that followed the Jacob Blake shooting in Kenosha Wisconsin saying “rioting is not protesting.” “I want to make it absolutely clear so I’m going to be very clear about all of this rioting is not protesting” he said. “Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It’s lawlessness plain and simple.” Biden’s rebuke of rioters and adulation of peaceful protesters reflects a bipartisan sentiment. President Donald Trump argued during his own trip to Kenosha that “these are not acts of peaceful protest but really domestic terror.” Attorney General Bill Barr similarly denounced “mob violence.” Barr urged Americans concerned about police shootings to trust the “due process” of the law and allow “dispassionate reasoned decision based on an analysis of the situation.” It’s not hard to find denunciation of looting from local officials — from Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot arguing that rioting was “not legitimate First Amendment-protected speech” to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz decrying property damage as “attacking civil society.” These politicians insistence on nondestructive protest echo President Richard Nixon’s civil rights era appeals for law and order amid riots against racial injustice. “Dissent is a necessary ingredient of change” Nixon said in 1968. “But in a system of government that provides for peaceful change there is no cause that justifies resort to violence.” Yet what Nixon Trump Biden and other elected officials miss is that America’s government frequently fails to provide meaningful avenues for peaceful change — particularly on police violence. If looting and rioting have no place in a well-functioning democracy then perhaps we should pause to consider that these are signs that Americans are not in fact in a functioning democracy. Rioting and unrest while tragic and destructive remains a historically familiar and rational response to state violence and weak democratic institutions. From the Boston Tea Party to John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry to the 1992 Los Angeles riots violent insurrections have served as a form of protest and resistance for centuries in the United States. Today’s riots still relatively rare roil after years of legal logjams and gridlock on meaningful policing reform. In the executive branch the recommendations from President Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing failed to be implemented nationwide. In the judicial branch legal precedent still protects officers from the consequences of deadly force with qualified immunity. In the legislative branch this summer’s police reform bills have stalled out. The institutional stalemate persists at the local level even in the bluest of districts like in New York City or Minneapolis where police brutality persists despite years of activism and electoral support for reform candidates. In declining to reconcile the failure of America’s democratic institutions and in their strong denouncements of riots as political protest elected officials like Trump and Biden avoid the truth — there is no more effective force for stopping riots than making a serious effort to stop police from killing Black people. Why looting happened in Kenosha and elsewhere in the US this summer On Sunday August 23 Jacob Blake was shot in the back by officers as they attempted to arrest him in Kenosha. Graphic video of the shooting shows an officer holding Blake by the end of his shirt and firing bullets into his back as he attempted to enter into his car. By that night protesters and demonstrators gathered to express their outrage and were further agitated as police pepper-sprayed them. As the night went on demonstrators set fire to dump trucks and local buildings. It was the beginning of a week of unrest and protests that mirrored destructive demonstrations seen earlier this summer following police violence. Perhaps we should pause to consider that looting and rioting are signs that Americans are not in a functioning democracy The unrest in places like Kenosha happens as local leaders show an inability to enact basic police reforms like firing police officers known for misconduct. Regardless of the specific details of any police shooting Black people have seen the same pattern play out over and over. As civil rights attorney and Democratic mayor of the very liberal city of Minneapolis Jacob Frey said of his inability to fire wayward officers: “We’re hamstrung by the architecture of this system that prevents change and protects officers from being held accountable. And if we really want to see the massive culture shift that is essential we need to have that ability. And right now in many instances the truth is we don’t.” Executive officials’ failure to fire violent officers on the front end is also matched with judicial officials’ failure to prosecute them on the back end. As observed in the absence of guilty verdicts after the killings of Elijah McClain Rekia Boyd Trayvon Martin Sandra Bland Tamir Rice Korryn Gaines Eric Garner Aiyana Mo’Nay Stanley-Jones Michael Brown Eleanor Bumpurs Freddie Gray and many many others the courts — a key site of democratic life — consistently fail to provide justice for Black people slain and deterrence to police or vigilantes who would unjustly slay Black folks again. America’s government repeatedly fails to provide meaningful avenues for peaceful change. In absence of that and in the presence of racial violence and discrimination some people lose faith in democratic institutions. “I don’t know where they got them motherfucking jurors from but that was some straight-up bullshit” Valerie Castile said in a Facebook Live video in 2017 after the police officer who killed her son Philando was found not guilty. “They’re gonna keep on killing us as long as we just sit down and just take it.” “I just want to say one thing to everybody out there I don’t give a fuck what you do” she added. “Do what your heart desires because that shit wasn’t right. Because I’m here to say that and fuck the police.” Castile’s disillusionment is common. It’s human. It’s rarely acknowledged however. Instead the heroes held up in media are the family members and activists who forgive their attackers or retain faith in the political system. Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah remarked on this selective storytelling in her GQ profile of Dylann Roof who killed nine Black people at a church in Charleston South Carolina in 2015. She said it was somewhat startling when one of the shooting survivors told the court that “Roof belonged in the pit of hell”: Their vitriol was warranted but also unexpected since in most of the press coverage of the shooting it had largely been erased. Almost every white person I spoke with in Charleston during the trial praised the church’s resounding forgiveness of the young white man who shot their members down. The forgiveness was an absolution of everything. No one made mention that this forgiveness was individual not collective. Some of the victims and their families forgave him and some of them did not. This same complex communal response helped fuel the riots in Kenosha last week. After watching a local Black man shot seven times in the back in front of his children some residents were saddened by property destruction and others were fine with it according to New York Times reporter Julie Bosman. Summarizing her reporting on The Daily she said: A lot of people said look this is a totally appropriate response to what happened to Jacob Blake. This is a totally appropriate response to the oppression of the Black community in this city and in this country. Like I talked to a man who was standing there smoking a cigarette. And just said “Look I’m really sorry to see this but like if this is what it takes then this is what it takes.” Incubated by generations of rejected appeals to legislative judicial and executive bodies the lure of violent unrest grows. This is evident not only in the upheaval that stretched from Atlanta to Wisconsin this year but in the periodic upheaval that has repeated across the last century. We tend to lionize peaceful movements — and forget the riots that also brought change In August 1943 the avenues of Harlem in New York City descended into chaos. Black people ran through the streets with their arms filled with coats jewelry and furniture. The young and the old the rich and the poor looted as much as possible from white store owners. A young Malcolm X watching it all unfold recounted seeing “all of these Negroes hollering and running north from 125th Street. Some of them were loaded down with armfuls of stuff.” The rioting the destruction was triggered by news of a police shooting. This is one of several scenes of unrest depicted in the University of Massachusetts Amherst historian Traci Parker’s book Department Stores and the Black Freedom Movement. The book recounts Black activism’s decades-long history both nonviolent and violent unfurling at stores. While Parker covers the famous sit-ins she also writes that “not all expressions of Black consumer protest and outrage however were so composed and organized; in fact several pointedly sought violent and destructive revenge.” During riots like the one in Harlem Parker explains that looters “were frustrated and angered by not only the reported killing but also the history of racial oppression and violence.” In her book Parker writes that riots didn’t just express public rage. They were at times even an effective mode of political advocacy prompting biased stories to reflect on biased business practices. “Wartime riots not only ended race discrimination in the marketplace but also created an awareness and discourse that would benefit the black freedom struggle in the postwar era.” Parker explains the decades-long persistence of both nonviolent and violent protests unfolding at retailers should inform how we understand the fight for racial justice. Rebutting the binary politicians like Bill Clinton posed last month between the legacy of nonviolent figure John Lewis and the less compromising Kwame Ture Parker tells Vox that “we have to understand that the Black freedom movement isn’t always about an either-or or a versus.” “We should be thinking about this as there are different organizations different tactics and strategies that are useful to get to a particular endpoint” she said. “It doesn’t have to be all or nothing one or the other. I’m not advocating for looting right. But I think that there could be other ways of thinking about this.” Whether looking at the looting in Watts in 1965 Detroit in 1967 Los Angeles in 1992 or Baltimore in 2015 many of America’s most infamous instances of racial unrest start after police brutality. In fact the autopsies and commissions investigating these uprisings describe a direct relationship between police violence and property destruction. Summarizing the findings of the 1968 Kerner Commission that investigated the civil rights era riots Princeton professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor writes that “the top three grievances it found in Black communities were police brutality unemployment and underemployment and substandard housing.” Today it is perhaps the New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie who most pithily expressed how this relationship works. “Kenosha would be quiet if not for an incident of police brutality and abuse” he wrote this week. “The same is true for other cities where rioting and disorder have taken place.” Nothing extinguishes a burning skyline like equality and justice for all Consulting the historical record we can see looting isn’t some random act of destruction. It isn’t the bloodthirst of the “mob” as Trump describes. It is political speech at times persuasive at times not that is made all the more common by weak democratic institutions. Like America’s burning forests America’s burning cities are the result of years of policy decisions. And like tackling climate change there is no quick fix for the underlying racial inequality that fuels unrest. Yet for those serious about tackling the problem at the scale that it exists blueprints are present. As Martin Luther King Jr. explained on similar riots in 1967: Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice equality and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. If politicians don’t want to see cities burn they must prioritize real change. The policy options are endless. Establishment Democrats have introduced the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020 which has provisions to make police more accountable in court. Progressives Democrats have introduced the Breathe Act which provides a framework for defunding. At the local level moderate reformers have suggested ideas such as 8 Can’t Wait’s plan to revamp police use-of-force policies. More progressive activists have pushed the 8 to Abolition to move toward less violent emergency response systems. Many plans exist but too few make it through the gears of American bureaucracy. Elected officials have options for expanding social justice and progress in communities long denied it. But until politicians heed demands to end police brutality America will continue to struggle with periodic riots and unrest as it has for generations.

The 9 queerest Disney movies,headline,https://www.vox.com/culture/21417212/what-are-the-gayest-disney-films-mulan-queer-subtext,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The biggest question surrounding the live-action Mulan now on Disney+ is whether it’s done justice to the 1998 animated film. But some fans have a much more specific question on their minds: Will 2020’s Mulan still be queer? If you’ve never really thought of Mulan as a queer film that’s okay. It does after all feature a heterosexual romance between its crossdressing title character and the military leader whose battalion she joins after disguising herself as a boy. But for many queer audiences Mulan is a seminal queer narrative — and it’s hardly the only Disney film to claim that honor. Throughout the pantheon of Disney films generations of queer Disney fans have found stories and characters that mirror themselves and their experiences. These films and characters arguably comprise the “queer canon” of Disney — and among them Mulan is arguably one of the most significant. Mulan’s struggle to accept her prescribed gender her sexual and gender confusion when she’s trying to fit in with all of the “other” boys in her squad are classic hallmarks of the identity struggles that countless queer and transgender teenagers face — especially in situations where they’re expected to conform to rigid gender roles. The introspective character ballad “Reflection” with its famous query “When will my reflection show who I am inside?” can easily be read as a transgender anthem and even includes a reference to “passing” a crucial concept in trans communities. What’s more in what seems to be a sly reference to the public discourse around queer and trans identity in the ’90s a character claims that if Mulan is allowed to crossdress “traditional values will disintegrate!” Then there’s the trope of the crossdressing hero getting entangled in a sexually confusing romance a plot that’s been used to inject queerness into stories since Shakespeare and beyond. Disney with its famous reticence toward depicting openly gay characters almost certainly didn’t intend to produce an overtly gay narrative in Mulan. Until this year’s Onward a Pixar film Disney didn’t have any textually queer characters in its films. No queer sidekicks were present let alone a main character. Yet Disney narratives have long been tied to the queer community partly by design. As Sean Griffin’s book Tinker Bells and Evil Queens notes Disney has long targeted gay audiences — and partly because queer audiences are experts at co-opting ostensibly straight narratives for themselves. “The idea that lesbians and gay men could be watching Disney and using the texts (films TV shows theme parks records etc.) to further a definition of their sexuality is initially stunning and provocative” Griffin wrote. “Historical evidence indicates that lesbians and gay men have read Disney artifacts from a non-heterosexual viewpoint throughout the company’s history ... as long as evidence showed that homosexual audiences were understanding Disney through a ‘gay sensibility’ then a relationship existed whether Disney approved of it or not.” The reason queer audiences have gotten so good at this co-opting is that when it comes to queer cinema queer and transgender stories are frequently interpreted through subtextual readings of ostensibly straight or cisgender narratives. Often these readings are inserted or hinted at intentionally in the film’s margins in a practice known as queer “coding.” This extrapolation of queer subtext is so commonplace that much of what we consider to be the queer cinema “canon” are films whose queer readings have had widespread cultural influence even if they themselves aren’t textually queer. See for example the widely established queer readings of films like Bride of Frankenstein or the intentionally queer-coded Rebel Without a Cause. Within the animated Disney canon these kinds of readings can be found everywhere. We can pick out repeated tropes and themes that allow us to describe films and characters as queer-coded. Disney’s plots frequently involve characters somehow undergoing a magical transformation outcast because of their differences and yearning to find their place within a loving society — all themes that can easily serve as queer and trans allegories or as “a queer-studies crash course.” Viewers frequently read vintage Disney films like Cinderella Peter Pan Pinocchio and Dumbo as containing queer and/or trans metaphors and the same goes for newer films like Lilo and Stitch and Tangled just to name a few. Of course most of these stories existed before Disney’s versions but the Disney versions helped popularize their narratives as well as strengthen their queer subtext. At the same time Disney’s villains in general have nearly all been queer-coded through troubling negative queer stereotypes. The male villains — villains like Sir Hiss and Prince John from Robin Hood; Ratigan from The Great Mouse Detective; Aladdin’s Jafar; The Lion King’s Scar; Pocahontas’s Governor Ratcliffe; Hercules’s Hades; Dr. Facilier from The Princess and the Frog; the list goes on — are typically variants of campy overly posh effeminate men whose effeminacy is a cause for suspicion and concern a reason to distrust them. The one notable exception to this rule is Beauty and the Beast’s Gaston a villain intentionally designed to be so manly that he becomes inherently homoerotic. (Observe for example how “the gay Gaston” is just ... Gaston.) Meanwhile female Disney villains tend to fall into two general categories. The first is full of campy drag queen variants like Cruella De Vil The Rescuers’ Medusa or The Little Mermaid’s Ursula (who was modeled after actual drag icon Divine). The second contains cold frigid types — think Cinderella’s stepmother the queen from Snow White Gothel from Tangled or Maleficent — who all fall into the negative cinema stereotype of the predatory older woman who’s become toxically obsessed with a beautiful young woman. Within this rather broad and complicated range of representation queer Disney fans have crafted their own subversive and celebratory readings. Villains regularly become gay icons; Disney princes are frequently reframed as gay men; and so many people have read Frozen’s Elsa as queer that the push to give her a girlfriend has become a prominent media narrative around that franchise. Elsa in particular as well as reimagined characters like Maleficent and Jafar in Disney’s recent live-action updates all represent a definitive recent shift away from the flamboyant queer villains of Disney’s past. It’s a shift that’s generated mourning among viewers over the loss of such sassy and colorful characters even while they recognize that such stereotyped queer coding was full of problems. Disney’s pivot away from negative tropes hasn’t exactly been smooth however; recall the jubilant headlines around 2017’s Beauty and the Beast live-action redux which promised that Josh Gad’s updated version of Le Fou Gaston’s fumbling sidekick would be Disney’s first definitively queer character. Yet his on-screen queerness was reduced to a quick shot of him dancing with a man which was barely one second long. It’s understandable then that some viewers might be nervous when it comes to how queerness will manifest in the updated Mulan. The new film already deviates from the original in other ways — it’s lost most of the songs removed many of the comical aspects and even jettisoned the original love story. But whether or not the animated character retains her (or his) queer sensibility when transferred into live-action form the original Mulan remains a queer cinema staple. Alongside Mulan here are the films we believe are the queerest in the Disney canon. Notably all of these films most of which are animated come from after the “Eisner era” of Disney films known as the “renaissance” that began with 1989’s The Little Mermaid under former Disney CEO Michael Eisner. It’s probably not a coincidence that several of these films involved Howard Ashman a gay musical lyricist who co-wrote the scores to The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast and shaped the story concept of Aladdin before his death in 1991. Ashman’s imprint on the Disney canon reminds us how much more meaningful it is when queer creators get to put versions of themselves onscreen — and allow queer viewers to glimpse their own reflections in the movies they love. Numerous older Disney films are certainly open to queer readings — *taps button reading “Ask Me About My Queer Reading of Pinocchio”* — but let me hazard a queer reading of Robin Hood my favorite Disney movie as a kid. Disney took the Robin Hood story and filled it with anthropomorphic animals then didn’t bother doing heavily sexed presentations of those animals unlike say Lola Bunny in Space Jam. This gives the film a strangely androgynous society where you mostly know a character is a man or a woman because they tell you they are and/or because of what they happen to be wearing at the time. And yet Robin Hood and his friends are fond of dressing up of playing roles of blurring the lines of identity in a way that feels very queer. Identities are often messy! What’s more the film’s presentation of a lovable band of outcasts living on the fringes of society and actively hunted down by the powers that be has numerous resonances with the ways that queer culture historically hid out on the edges of Western society. Robin and his friends long for a world where they are invited into mainstream society while still getting to be their super cool selves which they get when King Richard returns at the end of the film and he’s not just a lion but a True Ally. Anthropomorphic animals allow for kids (and adults) to divorce themselves from who they are and consider just who they might actually be. Furries quite literally consider this question of the liminal space between identities but everybody can find something to examine in cartoon animals. If you’re a little boy who has a crush on fox Robin Hood maybe that leads you to accept yourself sooner. If you’re a little girl (that everybody thinks is a little boy) who loves to watch Robin pretend to be a woman fortune teller maybe that leads you somewhere else. Anthropomorphic animals allow us to see something just human enough to sympathize with while allowing us just enough of a remove to question everything about ourselves. As the classic Disney movie most full of anthropomorphic animals (at least until Zootopia) Robin Hood belongs in the queer Disney canon. —Emily VanDerWerff There are numerous reasons to include The Little Mermaid in the queer Disney canon. To begin with there’s Ursula a flamboyantly campy villain who lives to be over the top. You could imagine her as a drag queen as a particularly revolutionary lesbian who longs to destroy the cis-heteronormative patriarchy or as a Harvey Fierstein character. And that’s before you get to the fact that she was modeled on Divine the drag performer who worked extensively with queer cinema icon John Waters. But forget Ursula! We know about Ursula! I just told you about Ursula! Let’s talk Ariel the heroine of the film one of the core Disney princesses and a bastion of compulsory heterosexuality. Or is she? Okay textually yeah she’s just a half-girl/half-fish who longs to be all girl and she falls in love with a handsome prince and at the end she gets married in a lavish wedding. She’s not particularly queer — unless you’re a trans woman. Where many trans guys connect with Mulan many trans girls connect with Ariel the girl who will never be seen as a girl until she has a sea witch perform an elaborate transformation on her then loses her voice the second she’s allowed to be herself. (Is this a metaphor for vocal dysphoria — wherein some trans people feel discomfort around the sound of their voice — or for the ways that trans women suddenly find themselves ignored and talked over after coming out in ways their cis women counterparts are all too familiar with? Honestly take your pick. The Disney canon isn’t exactly full of princesses for a trans girl to latch onto. Mulan’s entry into masculine spaces is celebrated for example because women embracing traits strongly associated with masculinity is celebrated in fiction. But the inverse is rarely true — when’s the last time you saw a male-coded character celebrated for embracing traits strongly associated with femininity in a kids movie? So we trans girls have Ariel but honestly that’s fine. She’s fun she’s feisty and “Part of Your World” is about when you really want to sit with the girls in your class at lunch but they won’t let you. I sing a mean “Part of Your World.” Ask me sometime at karaoke. —EV There are a few characters in the Disney canon like Beauty and the Beast’s Gaston who are seen as homoerotic paragons. I’d also argue that flamboyant candelabra Lumiere is despite his entanglement with the French feather duster a Kinsey 5. But perhaps the most heartbreaking gay reading of Beauty and the Beast involves the story of the Beast himself. The Beast’s curse to live as the reviled monster forever if he can’t find love before his 21st birthday — was according to director Bill Condon who helmed the 2017 live-action remake a way for original lyricist Howard Ashman to tell a story about his own struggle with AIDS. “Specifically for him it was a metaphor for AIDS” Condon told Attitude magazine in 2017 around the release of the remake. “He was cursed and this curse had brought sorrow on all those people who loved him and maybe there was a chance for a miracle and a way for the curse to be lifted. It was a very concrete thing that he was doing.” There’s also a moment where the townsfolk blinded by their prejudice declare “we don’t like what we don’t understand / in fact it scares us / and this monster is mysterious at least.” That isn’t unlike the prejudice felt by gay men like Ashman who was dealing with AIDS complications while writing the lyrics for the songs of the original animated movie. On the surface Beauty and the Beast is about finding true love and seeing beyond appearances. But dig a little deeper and the movie also delivers an important message about compassion and empathy and extending love to marginalized people who society too often deems unworthy of it. —Alex Abad-Santos The Lion King’s Scar follows the shopworn trope of a gay-coded villain: He preens flips his hair saunters in ways that his very stiff brother Mufasa doesn’t. He loves to talk about succession and monarchy. And with regard to the latter because he can’t even dream of defeating his brother when it comes to a test of masculinity and strength Scar resorts to sabotage and subterfuge to ascend to the throne. His iconic song “Be Prepared” could easily be called “Listen Up Fives a 10 Is Speaking.” Scar subverts the rules of order and the very precious Circle of Life. On the one hand Scar and many stereotypically portrayed characters like him feel like the byproducts of lazy and unimaginative writing (oh wow another limp-wristed gay-ish villain!). But on the other Scar has been embraced by Disney fans LGBTQ+ fans in particular who see him as subversive and one of Disney’s greatest villains. And it’s important to understand why. Since gay people haven’t ever been allowed to be the heroes of Disney movies no one can really blame us for taking our crumbs and appreciating the bombastic oppositional unapologetically queer villains like Scar. He may be a villain but at least Scar is an architect of his own devious life. The Lion King has a couple of less-villainous queer-coded characters in Pumba and Timon Simba’s two nihilistic adoptive gay dads. But even they don’t seem like they’re having half as much fun as Scar as he unleashes his dark vision everywhere the light touches. —AAS Thematically Hunchback is one of the queerest Disney films. As in the famed Victor Hugo novel upon which the Disney film is loosely based the plot centers around a man whose physical deformity renders him a social pariah. Quasimodo has been brought up by an evil politician who’s confined him his entire life within the borders of the Notre Dame Cathedral. Judge Frollo’s actions are ruled by his own repressed sexual desires which grow until they render him desperate and diabolical. Quasimodo is the only one who can unmask him and reveal his hypocrisy to the world. A deeply controversial film at the time of its release because of its dark and cynical even sinister view of organized religion Hunchback is perhaps Disney’s most intense film. Every minute of it is crowded with beauty from the stunning visuals to the beautiful lush score by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. And it’s completely suffused with the kind of towering emotions you’d expect from a story about two intensely passionate men who are both struggling to break free of their restraints in wildly different ways. Frollo’s sexual hypocrisy and raging hatred of Esmeralda the object of his desires makes him the perfect allegory for modern-day homophobes. His story also doubles as the suffocating debilitating nature of the closet itself. By contrast Quasimodo is literally confined physically to the “closet” of the church but his longing for freedom is soaring and desperate and inspiring. It prompts Disney’s best “I Want” song which is also one of the gayest songs ever written “Out There.” In the song after Frollo reminds him that the world will never understand his deviance Quasimodo longs to have just one day to spend outside (the closet). He longs to “live like ordinary men” who are “heedless of the gift” of normalcy they have. He’ll remember his one moment of freedom he claims when he’s “old and bent.” It’s a whole Pride parade in one song. —Aja Romano Is there a Disney movie with a queerer premise than “drag saves China”? That’s the crux of Mulan in which our heroine realizes through pretending to be a perfect bride and pretending to be a perfect soldier and failing at both that gender is ultimately performative. And her realization ultimately informs her plan of dressing Yao (Harvey Fierstein) and her fellow soldiers as women so they can bypass palace security and save China’s Emperor from the Huns. Mulan’s signature song “Reflection” is about never getting to express who she really is and always feeling like she must conceal and suppress who that person is. She pretends to be a man and enlists in the army to protect her ailing father. Because the movie features an Asian female protagonist who bucks Disney princess tradition by being a fierce fighter it’s easy to see how it resonates among a generation of young women and Asian Americans. But Mulan also functions as an allegory of living in a closet and the constant fear of being exposed and shunned by society for being who you truly are. What Mulan doesn’t know is that her greatest strengths are the very characteristics she’s been urged to hide — her intellect her quick thinking her ingenuity — and in the end they’re key to saving her country. And her story is arguably (with competition from Frozen) the most empowering coming out tale Disney has ever told. —AAS Because queerness has historically been an act of deviance and subversion queer villains have always been a cinematic mainstay — which means that reclaiming a villain and villainy itself is itself a common act of queer subversion. If only for this reason Maleficent is one of the gayest Disney films around. The live-action movie fully reclaims and softens the antagonism of one of Disney’s most popular villains the ice-cold fairy-slash-dragon from Sleeping Beauty — which is itself one of Disney’s arguably queer-coded fairy tales. In the new version Angelina Jolie’s Maleficent betrayed by her childhood love and wonderfully campily bitter about it fixates on his daughter Aurora. But unlike the original Charles Perrault fairy tale or the Disney legacy film Maleficent grows to love Aurora so much that it's her kiss not the handsome prince's that finally awakes Sleeping Beauty in the end. It’s all very sapphic and decidedly non-maternal. The updated take on Maleficent is perhaps one of Disney’s most obviously innocent outcasts which makes her story feel at times painfully queer. The moment early on in the film when someone she loves betrays her by slicing off her wings — ostensibly in order to “save” her — comes off like an excruciating form of conversion therapy. And just like all conversion therapy it fails and Maleficent emerges from the moment of trauma stronger angrier smarter and ready to be gay do crimes. —AR Elsa is perhaps the most famous character in the queer Disney canon because so far the Frozen films have gone out of their way to avoid saying she’s straight. They haven’t said that she’s queer but her lack of a dude love interest across the two Frozen films has caused plenty of queer folks to claim her as the Disney princess for them. The queer reading seems to some degree accidental in the first film. There the “true love” story is between sisters an intentional subversion of the Disney standard. Because of the sister story being the focus Elsa doesn’t have a handsome doofus to follow her around and try to win her love unlike her sister Anna who finds herself at the center of a genuine love triangle. Look beyond the text of the film and there’s plenty to suggest Elsa as subtextually queer. Her parents attempt to get her to hide her magic powers (perhaps a metaphor for queerness) deep down. When those powers emerge she is greeted with horror by society. Also “Let It Go” is all about what happens when something hidden deep within you bursts forth and it feels so great you have to sing about it. Frozen 2 all but drags Elsa’s queerness into the text though it chickens out at the last minute. She follows the voice of a mysterious woman into a strange forest where nothing is as it seems; there she meets a fetching young woman named Honeymeron. When they chat around the fire later there’s a slight undercurrent of romance. Elsa ultimately heads off into the unknown in search of hidden family secrets but at the film’s end she chooses to stay in the mysterious forest with these people who seem to know more about her than she does one of whom is Honeymeron. You really don’t have to squint to give this a queer reading. Many asexual folks also find representation in Elsa who just doesn’t seem like she can be bothered with the whole elaborate ritual of dating and marrying and mating. Similarly more than a few trans women see themselves in Elsa because of the elaborate transformation into a much more badass version of herself she undergoes in the first film. Truly Elsa contains multitudes and if you’re looking for a Disney film where the queerness is almost canon look no further than the Frozen duology. —EV Help keep Vox free for all Millions turn to Vox each month to understand what’s happening in the news from the coronavirus crisis to a racial reckoning to what is quite possibly the most consequential presidential election of our lifetimes.

Calls to #SupportBlackBusiness mean well, but can have drawbacks for business owners,headline,https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21419850/support-black-business-covid-19-george-floyd-protests-telfar,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Brittney Winbush founder of the wellness company Alexandra Winbush had her first $10000 sales day in June. Rather than purely elated though she was anxious. “Will this last?” she wondered. Over the past few months calls to #SupportBlackBusiness in the wake of the George Floyd protests — one of the biggest uprisings America has seen — have undoubtedly helped Black business owners. But many of them have enjoyed these boosts with trepidation about how long the support will last afraid to make long-term business decisions based on good faith as history has shown these moments of reckoning rarely linger. In 2009 Mahogany Books tweeted “#SBB = #SupportBlackBusiness” the first account to reportedly use the hashtag on social media. The tweet barely got any engagement. Fast-forward to 2020 and according to Google Trends the hashtag has seen a huge spike in interest. The timing of George Floyd’s death during a pandemic further illuminated how Black lives have been valued less. A reported 41 percent of Black businesses had been shut down in April due to Covid-19. Black businesses had been denied loans and other buffers the government had put in place while big mainstream businesses were offered millions. People were tired and wanted to see radical change. By June calls to #PulluporShutUp #ShowcaseYourWritersRoom share what #PublishingPaidMe and #SupportBlackBusiness dominated social media. For people who were sharing these hashtags the goal was likely to teach and inform others about substantial ways to support Black lives and so started the cycle of numerous lists and graphics. Influencers posted businesses and individuals to support on their Instagram feeds and mainstream media outlets created shared and reposted the lists. But these calls also reflected the limits and performativity of hashtag activism which can be short-lived if not taken beyond social media platforms that encourage fleeting attention. Others shared that the timing — right after a death that spurred protests — felt in some ways disrespectful. In a conversation with USA Today Kris Christian says that her coffee business which she started in 2016 saw sales surge by 225 percent. For Christian it was a bittersweet moment: It was great that she and other Black business owners were finally getting recognized but it was a recognition “birthed by a tragedy.” Some have wondered if this push to patronize Black-owned businesses can last and if the exchange of capital should be the main goal in the first place. As NYU business school professor Rachel Marie Brooks Atkins told the Washington Post “The campaign to ‘Buy Black’ is not new. Many people who study Black entrepreneurship are skeptical that even more widespread adoption can have a lasting impact. ... The challenges that Black businesses face are more fundamental than cashflow.” The reality too is that many small Black businesses due to their size aren’t equipped to handle such surges. Although such deluges can result in capital and growth until customers adjust expectations and push for structural reform that enables Black businesses to grow these calls will always feel inadequate. Late last year Winbush the owner of the wellness company set up a GoFundMe with a goal of $10000 to raise money to expand her business into an office space. “$10000 is so little to some in the entrepreneurial world but this money was giving me the capital cushion to hire someone restock and just grow” she says. For Winbush this was a testament to the disparities that Black entrepreneurs especially Black women entrepreneurs often face. Following the calls to #SupportBlackBusiness her business page was reshared by many white influencers and grew from 7000 followers to 20000 followers. She worried about whether this interest would convert to consistent sales; she noticed that a majority of the people who were creating these lists weren’t even making purchases themselves. “People are posting these Black-owned businesses without even researching to see what they do and what they support. It’s the same list going around. I’m not just a ‘Black-owned business.’ There are a lot of interesting things about me and my business besides my identity” says Subrina Heyink of Subrina Heyink Vintage. She declined interviews at the time and asked to be taken off lists once she realized that many of the people who were sharing them were doing so mindlessly in what felt like tokenism. She says that some of the white influencers sharing these lists were part of a racist fashion industry that had previously hurt her business: a former fashion editor who had once mocked Heyink for taking an activist tone on her platform had added her to an Instagram list of fashion businesses to follow. This upset Heyink so she asked for her name and business to be edited out of the Instagram post. More important than these lists says Heyink is the prospect of structural support in the form of mentorship for Black business owners particularly Black women entrepreneurs. She says her business saw growth earlier this year when she was given the capital and mentorship to grow and the accompanying knowledge that she could fail and try again. Still the lists that she had been added to brought new customers her way and she wasn’t about to let the demand overwhelm her. To prevent blowback from delays in shipment or bad reviews she communicated to customers about her business operations informed them about limitations that come with small businesses run by Black women and adjusted her inventory — listing only as many items as she could afford to fulfill without falling into extreme fatigue. In a similar vein bookstores across the nation have been inundated with requests for anti-racist books. For many of these small Black-owned businesses fulfilling orders has been difficult to keep up with. Boston’s Frugal Bookstore had been on the verge of closing in May when they received a surge in sales — 10000 orders between May 30 and June 1. These orders were mostly for titles which had been selling out everywhere forcing publishers to reprint. The company did not have the manpower to fulfill that many orders and so came the backlash from customers accusing the owners of theft and fraud. (An irony considering they were ordering books like How to Be an Antiracist White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism and Me and White Supremacy to name a few.) The owners posted a statement to customers after complaints: “We are also receiving a number of disheartening emails asking us to cancel orders and refund payments criticisms about how slow we are and that we have poor customer service because we have not answered an email. We do hope each and every one of you who has shown us support by purchasing through our website believe we are not accepting your money with the intention to keep it and not send out your orders.” The spike in demand over the last few months has caused many Black businesses across the nation to change their operations to meet customers’ wants. Liberian American designer Telfar had already seen great success with his “Bushwick Birkin” Shopping Bag; it had been selling out for months when Covid-19 hit and brought along an unceremonious drop from a Gap collaboration. The small company had channeled money into manufacturing products for the collaboration and thus the drop resulted in uncertainty and precarity despite the company’s popularity. Community rallying and hashtags not only brought Telfar and Gap to a resolution but also catapulted the bag to new heights of demand with the item selling out mere minutes after being released. This was cause for celebration yet brought with it resale bots and profiteers who wanted to capitalize off the attention a Black business was getting. These problems created complaints from consumers with some even accusing the company of creating false scarcity to drive demand. The company tried to address this by launching a “bag security” program allowing customers to preorder the bags they wanted. For Telfar the resellers were less of an issue than the tokenization. The designer told Hype Beast “We are not ‘inclusive’ — we are Black-owned and non-gendered since 2004. We went from marginalized to tokenized quick. Our move was to build our entire company within our own community — from customers to collaborators — and to one day be totally independent of the [fashion] industry.” A company representative declined to comment further. Other Black-owned businesses like golde and Hanahana Beauty also switched to a preorder model following an influx of orders. Abena Boamah founder and CEO of Hanahana Beauty had plans to scale up her business this year. Faced with the pandemic and consequent shipping delays she applied for a Paycheck Protection Program loan — with apprehension due to past refusals she had gotten applying for loans as a Black small business owner. After waiting weeks to hear back and getting no response she moved on. Around this time she began to appear on lists of Black businesses to support. Abena was excited she says because the majority of the lists — including one on Beyoncé’s website — reflected an understanding of Hanahana’s mission. Business got even better but in July the company announced that it was taking a “sustainable work vacation.” Making items available for preorder had helped Boamah but it wasn’t enough. She realized that the company couldn’t produce or fulfill enough orders at the rate things were going and it was important for her to keep in line with her company’s mission of sustainability and transparency. Despite the allure of new revenue she took a break so the team could rest hired new team members and applied for grants many of which had only become available to her after the pandemic and uprisings started. Even after orders are completed Black business owners have struggled with how to navigate shows of appreciation; many are making sure to restate their gratitude for fear of driving away customers some of whom have implied that for them #SupportBlackBusiness is an act of charity. Still others are figuring out exactly how to openly discuss the ways the influx of attention has affected operations for better and for worse. “Some Black business owners are scared to share the realities we face” Winbush says “because they don’t want to seem unprofessional as coming off as unprofessional could negatively impact your business.” Help keep Vox free for all Millions turn to Vox each month to understand what’s happening in the news from the coronavirus crisis to a racial reckoning to what is quite possibly the most consequential presidential election of our lifetimes.

One Good Thing: After the NBA walkout, Netflix’s High Flying Bird is the movie of the week,headline,https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/8/28/21405416/best-netflix-movies-steven-soderbergh-high-flying-bird-nba-boycott,www.vox.com,1600223579509
One Good Thing is Vox’s recommendations feature. In each edition find one more thing from the world of culture that we highly recommend. At the end of High Flying Bird a rookie NBA player receives a gift bestowed to him by his former agent: 1969’s seminal The Revolt of the Black Athlete by sociologist and civil rights activist Harry Edwards. It is then that the full meaning of Steven Soderbergh’s unconventional sports drama released on Netflix in February 2019 becomes clear. In a crisp 90 minutes the film covers thorny issues of labor and class of dreams lost and found of the pressure to deliver when millions of dollars livelihoods and legacies are on the line. But it is also a film about Black athlete empowerment. That makes it unusual for a Soderbergh picture; it’s one of the director’s few films with a non-white protagonist. High Flying Bird was written by Tarell Alvin McCraney who helped adapt his own stage play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue into the Best Picture winner Moonlight in 2016. High Flying Bird possesses that film’s same clarity about the predicament of Black people in America and likewise conveys its weighty themes with uncanny subtlety. And so on top of being a slyly funny and consistently engaging sports spin on more traditional legal dramas High Flying Bird also feels especially resonant in the days after NBA players stopped playoff games in an unprecedented protest following the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha Wisconsin. The circumstances of the plot could not be more different than the situation the NBA finds itself in today. The NBA is currently completing its season in a Disney World bubble during a pandemic. This week after the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin players decided not to play their scheduled games to send a message to the league especially its largely white owners about the need to be politically engaged. In the film the inciting incident is more mundane: The NBA has come to a standstill because of a contract dispute between the players union and the owners. Sports agent Ray Burke played by Moonlight’s Andre Holland must figure out how to tide over his new client a promising rookie named Erick Scott and end the lockout. Yet the same power dynamic that led to this week’s extraordinary events in which boycotting players persuaded their owners to turn basketball arenas into voting centers is essential to the film’s narrative. Burke explains in the opening scene the leverage that his client as a star player-in-waiting enjoys over his much more monied employers: “In order to move merch and inspire rap lyrics they need your services. Too much money at stake.” The story that follows is told with the kind of cinematic authenticity that typifies most of Soderbergh’s later work. The fictional narrative is intercut by interviews of real NBA players explaining the difficult transition to professional sports when teenagers a year out of high school and too young to drink receive contracts worth tens of millions of dollars. The film was shot on iPhones (with an anamorphic lens attached) to bring you to the table at a high-end restaurant and inside the cab where a critical meeting takes place. It possesses a propulsive energy thanks to the dialogue of McCraney’s script and Soderbergh’s editing. On one level watching Burke Sonja Sohn’s players union president and Zazie Beetz’s hypercompetent assistant try to outmaneuver one another and the NBA personified by a smarmy attorney played by Kyle McLaughlin is a breeze. They are smart people who care about their jobs and do them well with a knack for the withering one-liner. Melvin Gregg of American Vandal and Snowfall who plays Burke’s rookie client convincingly conveys both the reckless ego and the insecurity of an 18-year-old about to become unthinkably rich and famous. But the racial politics are never far from the surface. In an early scene Bill Duke’s wizened coach reminds Burke of why the NBA integrated Black players in the first place: The Harlem Globetrotters had become so popular that NBA owners worried they would be supplanted by a form of basketball played and controlled by Black athletes. “They wanted control of a game we play better” Duke’s character says. “They invented a game on top of a game.” But the players still hold powerful cards. Indirectly Duke’s history lesson gives Burke the inspiration he’ll need to help the NBA players use their leverage against the league get the contract dispute settled and start the games back up again. It’s in the film’s opening scene that Burke hands Scott a wrapped copy of The Revolt of the Black Athlete describing it as “a Bible” of sorts. But it’s not until the end that Beetz’s character opens it for him starts reading it herself and tells Scott: “You need to read this.” These are some of the words the rookie would have read in Edwards’s book from a 2016 Vice profile of the author: “We had learned the use of power–the power to be gained from exploiting the white man’s economic and almost religious involvement in athletics” Edwards wrote in The Revolt of the Black Athlete. “The revolt of the black athlete in America as a phase of the overall black liberation movement is as legitimate as the sit-ins the freedom rides or any other manifestation of Afro-American efforts to gain freedom.” “The goals of the revolt likewise are the same as those of any other legitimate phase of the movement–equality justice the regaining of black dignity lost during three hundred years of abject slavery and the attainment of the basic human and civil rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the concept of American democracy.” It was those precepts that the NBA players of our world put to use this week. Edwards spoke highly of their unprecedented protest and urged them to work toward concrete ends. On Friday after being advised by Edwards among others the NBA players union announced the deal it had reached with the league’s owners to end the boycott and resume play. The agreement included a commitment to convert arenas into voting centers and a pledge to spend money on advertising to encourage civic engagement ahead of the 2020 election. “The athletes who are boycotting today with the NBA are sending a message: We are serious about this” Edwards told Yahoo! Sports. “Stop killing us! It’s more important that we deal with that than we play a basketball game and entertain you out here. Stop killing us.” Pro basketball affords Black Americans disadvantaged and discounted in so many other parts of American political life an unparalleled platform. That is something the characters in High Flying Bird and the players in the NBA today understand well. High Flying Bird is streaming on Netflix.

If there’s one thing Stephen Guerriero has learned in his 18 years teaching middle-school students it’s that they thrive on structure and predictability. “I know that when I go into this classroom I start this warmup; I know that I need to bring this; I know that I have lunch every day at 11:15.” Routines like these he told Vox are “so linked to middle-school students’ sense of safety.” But when school buildings closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic this spring those routines were completely disrupted. And with the fall term beginning and the crisis still in full swing students’ predictable days aren’t coming back anytime soon. This can have an effect on their learning — but it has a major impact on their mental health too. Most students will be attending school either remotely or on a hybrid model with some days in classrooms and some days at home. And even these new routines are still in flux with some areas — including Needham Massachusetts where Guerriero teaches — delaying the start of in-person school due to concerns that aging school buildings simply aren’t ready to accommodate even a hybrid model. Add to that uncertainty the fact that the virus remains a real threat parents have lost jobs food insecurity has skyrocketed and teachers the trusted guides students rely on to get them through a radically different school environment are also afraid of what will happen to them and their families if they return to buildings that may be unsafe. For everyone involved the pandemic has been “a collective trauma” Guerriero said. And while some families have the resources to help kids adjust to the new normal others are going into their sixth month of unemployment or dealing with the demands of online school without reliable internet or space for kids to study. “Their stress level is going up” Sarah Y. Vinson a psychiatrist in the Atlanta area who works with kids across the income spectrum told Vox. Experts fear that for students around the country the stresses of the pandemic could lead to anxiety depression or difficulties with learning and that groups hardest hit by Covid-19 including Black and Latinx Americans could be the most affected. “The communities that already had less room for air have of course been hit hardest” Vinson said. To help students across American society cope with the loss of their routines adjust to new ones and begin to heal from the stress of living in a global public health emergency Guerriero and others say schools need to focus on kids’ emotional needs — perhaps even before they worry about the curriculum. “Coping strategies and skills that oftentimes would be ancillary to what we were doing in the classroom” he said “now it’s going to have to be the primary thing.” The pandemic has put students’ mental health at risk Before Covid-19 hit school was a constant in the lives of millions of American kids — a place they went to learn play eat lunch (and often breakfast) and socialize with their peers. The latter is key — in normal times schooling by its very nature is a space for social interaction “and a place where we can connect and build these relationships” Justina Schlund director of field learning at the nonprofit CASEL: Collaborative for Academic Social and Emotional Learning told Vox. But in the spring with schools nationwide shifting to remote learning kids lost that physical space to connect with each other and with teachers. And while educators were once able to create a supportive place for education in their classrooms they suddenly had to rely on kids and families to construct such places at home. “Now out of my 100 kids I have 100 different learning environments” Guerriero said. Without a teacher in the room to keep them on task students have to rely much more heavily on executive functioning skills like self-control — which aren’t fully developed in middle schoolers to begin with. As a result “they feel like they’re working harder they feel lonelier they feel like if they’re struggling with something they’re the only one” Guerriero said. Kids who get mental and behavioral health services at school for disabilities or learning differences are also facing additional disruption. “All these professionals that normally connect with kids in person in school now you’re over Zoom” Guerriero said. “It’s just not the same.” This has particularly impacted districts with a higher percentage of low-income families Vinson said. Overall the challenges of online education and the general isolation and stress of the pandemic could lead to a spike in mental health problems among kids. While nationwide data on the impact of the pandemic is still sparse one study of students in China’s Hubei province an early Covid-19 hot spot found that 22.6 percent reported depression symptoms and 18.9 percent had symptoms of anxiety after about a month in lockdown. And in the US a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) survey conducted in June found an increase in anxiety and depression among adults since the pandemic began NPR reported on Thursday. Experts are concerned about a possible uptick in suicides among teenagers and young adults with one in four 18- to 24-year-olds telling the CDC they had “seriously considered” suicide in the last 30 days. Anecdotally Vinson saw an uptick in anxiety and sadness among her patients in the spring as well as increases in psychotic symptoms among patients who already exhibited those before the pandemic. Now “some families have been able to sort of re-equilibrate and find a new normal and for those kids some of them are doing better than they were in April or May” Vinson said. In other cases — where a parent has lost a job for example or where lack of internet access makes online learning impossible — kids are doing even worse. And the overall environment in a country where the response to the virus has been slow confusing and politicized from the very beginning isn’t helping. “Even if a child isn’t aware of what President Trump said there’s a certain amount of just tension and uncertainty” Vinson said. “Whether they can connect the dots or not there’s a way that being in a stressful environment and stressful community absolutely impacts how kids do.” How schools districts and families can help support kids’ mental health Despite these challenges experts say there are ways for schools districts and families to help kids through this unprecedented time. For Vinson it’s important to start with making sure students’ most basic needs are met. “Kids’ nutritional status and having reliable consistent access to food is really important in terms of how they do mentally” she said. “School lunch and school breakfast in certain communities is something that families rely upon.” Programs to continue providing meals while school buildings are closed such as one launched by the Miami-Dade County school district in the spring are crucial for kids’ mental as well as physical health. And to make sure kids without internet at home can still connect to their schools programs like mobile wifi hot spots or in-person learning hubs can be helpful Vinson said. The San Francisco school district for example has pledged to set up hubs serving 6000 students where they can get supervision and access to wifi if those aren’t available at home. When it comes to the content of classes many say that social and emotional learning — “learning who I am my emotions my identity my values and how that fits into the larger world” according to Schlund — is more important than ever. In collaboration with other education groups CASEL has put together a slate of recommendations for supporting students’ social and emotional learning during the pandemic that is being used by a number of school districts around the country including those in Chicago and Baltimore. The recommendations include strengthening relationships between schools and families something the Cleveland school district did in the spring with a program to call every family to make sure kids had what they needed for remote school. They also include embedding opportunities for social and emotional learning in the remote school day — for example by having students discuss current events and how they connect to their daily lives and “using that discussion to help students think about what actions they can take to support themselves their families or their communities during this time” Schlund said. Schools can help students meet the challenges of pandemic schooling by taking care of their social needs as much as possible. The school where Guerriero teaches for example is organizing online clubs around nonacademic interests like student leadership and spirit days. Schools also need to be thoughtful about how they manage transitions like the shift from hybrid to fully remote if there are positive cases because those transitions risk upsetting kids’ sense of predictability and making them feel alienated from school. “When they feel disconnected it’s almost impossible to reconnect to them remotely” Guerriero said. Of course for many families school this year is as much about what goes on at home as what happens on Zoom. And parents can do a lot to support their kids’ mental health during a difficult time. “One of the things that’s really important is to have a good baseline of how your child functions” so you can spot any problems early on Vinson says. And even though families may be spending lots of time in the same physical space parents should make sure “it’s quality interactive time where they really do have your full attention and you have theirs so you can have a sense of how you’re doing.” Getting exercise in some form is also helpful for mental health Vinson says and it’s something families can do together. And protecting kids’ sleep is also crucial. Especially for older kids that might mean having them hand over their phone to a parent in the evening so they actually go to sleep when it’s time for bed. “Given that we know this is a more stressful time” for kids Vinson said “we want to put them in the best position possible for their little brains to handle it.” The CASEL recommendations also emphasize the importance of supporting teachers and staff so that they in turn can take care of students’ needs. “Schools are places where we’re really relying on adults to play important roles in supporting students socially emotionally and academically” Schlund said. “But we don’t often recognize that they themselves are experiencing the same types of stress and potential trauma.” Schools and districts can support teachers by making sure their health insurance covers mental health care having employee-assistance programs in place to offer crisis counseling and referrals and giving teachers the ability to take time off if they need it Guerriero said. “We’re going to be in front of these traumatized students as traumatized people ourselves” he explained. “It’s so important for us to take care of our mental health.” Overall experts and educators agree that while kids crave structure they’re also often highly adaptable and resilient. And the transition to online school hasn’t been wholly negative — some kids prefer remote education perhaps because they were bullied or ostracized in their classrooms Vinson said. But to help the kids who are struggling and to support everyone’s ability to learn and heal schools and families alike need to understand how deeply different this year is from what came before. Guerriero for his part might start his first class of the school year with some icebreakers — in the spring “we’d do silly things like kids holding up a pet to a camera” he said. But “my main message to them will be you don’t have to know everything I’m telling you right now” he said. “I just want you to know that I’m going to take care of you I’m going to be with you for the whole year and if you have questions you can come and ask me.” Help keep Vox free for all Millions turn to Vox each month to understand what’s happening in the news from the coronavirus crisis to a racial reckoning to what is quite possibly the most consequential presidential election of our lifetimes.

How the Milwaukee Bucks kicked off a historic NBA protest,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/8/26/21403179/milwaukee-bucks-nba-protest-jacob-blake,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The NBA postponed playoff games Wednesday night after the Milwaukee Bucks refused to play in their matchup in solidarity with Jacob Blake a Black man who was shot by police seven times in the back this weekend in Kenosha Wisconsin. The team was scheduled to tip off against the Orlando Magic at 4 pm Wednesday for Game 5 of their seven-game first-round playoff series but they never emerged from the locker room. The Magic who are currently losing the series three games to one are “not accepting the Bucks’ forfeit” according to NBA reporter Shams Charania. The Bucks’ protest makes sense: Not only was Blake shot just several dozen miles from their training facility they also have had experience with police brutality before. In September 2018 a Bucks player forward Sterling Brown was tased and arrested by Milwaukee police but never charged. But even before the association postponed all the night’s games the Bucks didn’t seem like they would have been alone for long — several other teams were considering doing the same. The Houston Rockets and the Oklahoma City Thunder who were scheduled to face each other later on Wednesday decided to boycott their own Game 5 matchup as have the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers. The NBA has had a long history of player activism: Professional basketball players in 2014 donned “I can’t breathe” shirts in solidarity with Eric Garner who was killed by police. One of the league’s biggest stars LeBron James has become a major political force for racial justice and voting rights and multiple players joined protests after the police killing of George Floyd in May. Wednesday’s walkout — which could become an official strike later Wednesday night — is a powerful escalation of that tradition. Alex Lasry the senior vice president of the Bucks organization voiced his support for the players on Twitter. “Some things are bigger than basketball” he tweeted. “The stand taken today by the players and org shows that we’re fed up. Enough is enough. Change needs to happen.” A not-so-surprising surprise boycott The team’s refusal to play is historic — but not completely out of the blue. Earlier this week Bucks guard George Hill expressed regret about traveling to the NBA bubble in Orlando Florida for the league restart. “Coming here just took all the focal points off what the issues are” Hill said Monday. “But we’re here. It is what it is. We can’t do anything from right here. But definitely when it’s all settled some things need to be done.” During a Wednesday press conference in which players for the Toronto Raptors spoke about the difficulty of watching another Black man be shot by police Fred VanVleet and Norm Powell discussed other options for advancing the conversation around racial justice. “I think everybody’s at the point (where) sitting up here and saying Black Lives Matter — and sitting up having discussions and Zoom calls and this that and the other putting apparel on — that’s not getting the job done” Powell said. “Taking the knee for the anthem that’s not getting the job done. It’s starting to get washed out. I feel like Black Lives Matter is just another part of the conversation now because you see it so much. It’s everywhere.” Nonetheless the boycott is said to have taken the NBA by surprise. “The NBA owners and front offices didn’t see this wave of player boycotts coming today” NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski said Wednesday. “Hours ago they all expected to be playing these games tonight. This is a pivot point for the NBA and professional sports in North America.” Now it’s a question of how far things will go: In a statement released shortly after the boycott the NBA announced that all three Wednesday games — Bucks-Magic Rockets-Thunder and Lakers-Blazers — would be rescheduled. However it’s unclear if any of the teams involved will agree to play at a later date. According to Sports Illustrated reporter Chris Mannix several teams including the league-champion Toronto Raptors have discussed leaving the playoff bubble and going home entirely. Jared Weiss reported that the NBA players association will hold a union meeting Wednesday night where they will debate holding a vote to officially go on strike. The protest could also spread beyond basketball: At least one baseball team the Milwaukee Brewers have announced they will not play a scheduled Wednesday game.

Facebook initially failed to remove a Kenosha militia page despite complaints,headline,https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/26/21403361/facebook-kenosha-militia-page-event-complaints-jacob-blake-shooting-protests,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us. Facebook didn’t take heed when its users sounded the alarm about a militia group issuing a “call to arms” on its platform. That call to arms came before the violence in Kenosha Wisconsin on Tuesday night which left two people dead and one injured according to a new report. A man who has been arrested as a suspect in the shooting reportedly self-identified as a militia member though he was not a follower of the Facebook page users had flagged. Before the shooting at least two Facebook users flagged a page called “Kenosha Guard” for inciting violence according to The Verge. But the company told users that the page did not meet the company’s criteria for removal. On Wednesday morning after violence at the protests already broke out — and armed militia groups took to the streets — Facebook ended up taking down the page for violating its policies on dangerous groups. Just last week Facebook expanded its Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy to include domestic militia groups that encourage violence. But in spite of those recent efforts it seems that some of the content and groups the company has deemed dangerous under this new policy are still slipping through the cracks. Facebook told Recode that it may have rejected users’ requests to take down the Kenosha Guard militia page because those requests weren’t initially routed to the right team. Once Facebook’s newly formed specialized team working on identifying dangerous militia groups looked at the group the company said it took the page and a corresponding event down. Facebook also said the shooting suspect 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was not a member of the Kenosha Guard Facebook page or invited to the associated event. The company says it has removed Rittenhouse’s accounts on Facebook and Instagram. Do you work at Facebook and want to talk? Please email Shirin Ghaffary at shirin.ghaffary@protonmail.com to reach her confidentially. Signal number available upon request. “At this time we have not found evidence on Facebook that suggests the shooter followed the Kenosha Guard Page or that he was invited on the Event Page they organized” said a spokesperson for Facebook. “However the Kenosha Guard Page and their Event Page violated our new policy addressing militia organizations and have been removed on that basis.” Regardless of Facebook’s eventual removal of the militia group some groups are criticizing the company for not taking action sooner — saying the situation is part of a larger pattern of not responding quickly enough to calls to violence on its platform. “This crisis of hate-fueled violence requires immediate drastic action from Facebook and all other platforms on which these groups gather” said Rashad Robinson president of the civil rights group Color of Change in a statement to Recode. “Facebook’s superficial policy changes mean nothing when they aren’t enforced.” This week demonstrators in Kenosha have taken to the streets to protest the police shooting of Jacob Blake a 29-year-old Black man who witnesses at the scene said was unarmed and was simply trying to break up a dispute. Tensions have increased at these protests as armed militia who say they support the police have showed up to counter protesters. Facebook has struggled many times in recent years with how to deal with extremists and other groups associated with violence who often use its platform to organize and build out their groups. Back in 2017 Facebook was criticized for letting the white supremacist Unite the Right Rally which resulted in three deaths and dozens of injuries keep its event page online for a month before it was taken down the day before the event. More recently members of the far-right Boogaloo movement have attempted to organize violent insurrections against members of the US government on Facebook such as plotting the murder of a federal agent in Oakland California. In the past few months Facebook has expanded its policies to restrict dangerous groups even if they are not overt terrorist organizations including domestic militias members of the Boogaloo movement and supporters of the conspiracy theory QAnon. But Facebook’s delay in taking down the Kenosha Guard page shows that enforcing its new policies will be complicated and imperfect — after all these groups have built themselves in part by using its platform.

The NBA strike is a big moment for athlete activism,headline,https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/9/4/21420033/jacob-blake-nba-strike-2020-black-lives-matter,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The sports world erupted in protest last week in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha Wisconsin. On August 26 Milwaukee Bucks players announced just prior to game time that they would not participate in their first-round playoff game against the Orlando Magic. The rest of the NBA playoff teams soon joined in this wildcat strike. Their actions reverberated. Tennis star Naomi Osaka voluntarily forfeited her semifinal match before the next day’s games in the Western & Southern Open the following day and officials suspended play as a result. Some MLS NHL NFL MLB and WNBA teams also followed suit with the New York Mets and the Miami Marlins among others leaving the field after a silent protest while placing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt over home plate. The NBA strike came to an end and playoffs resumed a couple days later after the league secured some concessions including the use of several basketball arenas as voting locations and the formation of a league-wide social justice coalition. In an era marked by historic levels of economic inequality and mass mobilization in response to Black Lives Matter and the actions of the Trump administration we ought not to be surprised by this latest burst of activism. Today’s professional players join a long lineage of athletes from Muhammad Ali to Billie Jean King who used their careers as a way to protest social injustice. But something different also happened last week. The NBA players went on strike shutting down their industry (at least temporarily) and demanding concessions from their employers before returning to the court. This act of workplace stoppage represents the next step in athlete protests. Beyond raising awareness or starting conversations striking has the potential to bring about change by grinding an industry’s gears to a halt. The act of striking has been dramatically on the rise during the Trump administration. The number of union-led workplace stoppages — including those involving 1000 or more people — has exploded in the last few years. Many have focused more narrowly on the wages and conditions at the worker’s job site such as the teacher’s strikes throughout a number of traditionally conservative states in 2018 and 2019 which won the support of the public and — perhaps just as important — a notable increase in pay and benefits. But increasingly they are also being used to promote causes beyond improving workplace conditions. New York taxi drivers struck in 2017 to protest the Trump administration’s so-called Muslim ban. In the last few months longshore workers on both US coasts struck for Black Lives Matter (not surprising given the group’s longer history of striking to protest police violence war and civil rights). That these actions are being carried out by unionized workers isn’t a coincidence. Nonunionized workers are frequently classified as “at will” meaning that they can be terminated for just about any reason and certainly for political protest. Constitutional rights do not automatically extend to the workplace and indeed the rights of the employer can be more accurately understood as authoritarian. Meanwhile unionized workers are protected by national labor laws against unjust termination and strikes and work stoppages are importantly if conditionally protected under the law. National labor law requires a “direct nexus” between the work stoppage and the conditions of the workplace but the National Labor Relations Board has often interpreted this nexus in broad strokes. In 2017 the NLRB protected the rights of workers to strike on behalf of the rights of immigrants arguing that there was both a connection to the striking workers’ employment conditions and that employers had the potential to help respond effectively by leveraging their power with the federal government. The leading role of unionized workers in this era’s protests also gets at labor’s potential to drive fundamental change. Unionized workers are part of organizations that are designed to promote solidarity mobilize collectively and protect their workers from employer threats of coercion. Recent research has shown how unions mobilize workers to vote learn about politics and even reduce their feelings of racial resentment. The close linkages between these unionized athletes political protest and the growing social movement around Black Lives Matter remind us of the importance that labor unions offer for progressive politics and the future growth of the Democratic Party. Of course unions are not a panacea by themselves. Indeed the labor movement has a long and quite complicated relationship to civil rights and the events that have led to Black Lives Matter. Even in the current era in which many unions have emphatically embraced diversity and civil rights in their workplaces and in politics national unions have wrestled with the presence of law and immigration enforcement and other correction officer unions within their ranks. (Police unions for example are known for strongly protecting members who have records of violent interactions with citizens.) Moreover not every unionized worker has the power and leverage of often well-known and extremely well-paid professional athletes. Taxi drivers taking a stand against racism do so within an industry under economic threat and many unionized and would-be unionized workers — from those in slaughterhouses to graduate teaching assistants to gig economy workers — face severe threats of termination from employers facing labor laws with only limited weapons. But that does not take away from both the historic events of the past week and the path they pave for future action. Movement mobilization and union organization have and can reinforce and benefit from each other providing and sustaining a potentially transformative political moment.

Elizabeth Warren calls for investigation into Trump’s politicization of Covid-19,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/8/26/21402553/trump-covid-19-elizabeth-warren-coronavirus-pandemic-kushner,www.vox.com,1600223579509
President Trump has made every aspect of his response to Covid-19 political from his resistance to mask-wearing to his insistence on reopening schools to his sparring with Democratic governors over lifesaving tests and personal protective equipment. His administration has even been accused of scrapping a nationwide testing plan after a team convened by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner determined that the epidemic would hit blue states the hardest and Democratic governors could be blamed for it. Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is calling for an investigation of Trump’s politicization of the virus and the unnecessary death and damage it may have caused. In a letter sent on Tuesday and obtained by Vox exclusively ahead of publication Warren and Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Edward Markey (D-MA) write that “President Trump and his advisors have repeatedly put their partisan political interests ahead of the health and welfare of the American people.” They detail a host of allegations including reports that Trump pressured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to weaken its recommended restrictions for reopening churches and that he agreed to pay for National Guard troops in only two states Florida and Texas because their governors made “special direct cases to the President.” Echoing a call that Warren Blumenthal and Markey first made in April the senators ask the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) an oversight body created by the CARES Act to investigate the Trump administration’s conduct. It’s unclear whether the PRAC will take up such an investigation or what effect it would have — the committee has not responded publicly to the senators’ April letter. And Trump has already intervened in the operations of the group removing its leader in April after citing nonspecific “reports of bias.” Still the senators’ letter adds to the chorus of voices charging that the president has turned a national crisis into an opportunity for political gain effectively leaving tens of thousands of Americans to die. “Americans are seeking trustworthy objective information and leadership to help them navigate this unprecedented crisis but the administration’s repeated prioritization of President Trump’s political interests calls into question the integrity of every action of the federal government” they write. “It will be impossible to develop an effective federal response until this partisan interference is addressed and public trust can be restored.” Warren and her colleagues say Trump has repeatedly played politics with a national crisis In addition to a call for an investigation the letter by Warren and colleagues also serves as a public indictment of the president’s Covid-19 response during which he has admitted to punishing those he sees as critical of him. These are just some of the ways the senators say the president has put politics ahead of American lives: His administration decided not to implement a nationwide testing plan because it believed mostly Democrats were dying. By early April such a plan had been developed by a team led by Kushner Vanity Fair reported in July. But one expert told the magazine a member of the team expressed the view that because the virus was hitting blue states hardest a nationwide strategy didn’t make sense politically. “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states that they could blame those governors and that would be an effective political strategy” the expert told Vanity Fair. Ultimately a nationwide plan was largely abandoned and most testing was left to states resulting in bottlenecks delays and likely deaths. “The federal government has repeatedly abdicated its responsibility to manage and improve the country’s testing infrastructure deepening our national emergency and costing lives” the senators write. He plays favorites among states rewarding loyal Republican governors with federal dollars. For example Trump reportedly promised to pay the full cost of sending National Guard troops to Florida and Texas to help with the pandemic response but did not do the same for other states. “The National Governors Association reported that governors across the country had asked for the same arrangement including in states with higher numbers of COVID-19 cases but the only requests granted initially were those from Texas and Florida whose governors enjoy a close personal and political relationship with the President and that had voted for President Trump in the 2016 election” the senators write; “other states will face 25 percent cuts to their federal support later this month.” He has pressured the CDC to change its guidelines for political ends. For example after the agency released its initial guidance on school reopenings in July Trump tweeted “I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!!!” The CDC then issued new softened guidance the senators write and the White House reportedly edited at least one of the documents included. “The Administration appears to have prioritized its political interest in reopening over the advice of the CDC’s public health experts undermining the public credibility of the guidance issued by the agency and making the ongoing pandemic significantly worse” the senators continue. He has hyped unproven and potentially dangerous treatments for the virus. Earlier this year Trump repeatedly touted the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine to fight Covid-19 even claiming that he was taking it himself as a preventive measure. The Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the drug in March but revoked it in June after reports that the drug was associated with serious heart problems the senators write. But Trump administration officials criticized the FDA’s move and Rick Bright the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) has filed a whistleblower complaint saying he was pressured “to direct resources toward this unproven and ineffective treatment” in violation of FDA rules the senators write. “These events raise concerns about whether the Trump Administration will respect the scientific process around approval or authorization of COVID-19 vaccines with President Trump already pushing for a vaccine to be ready before Election Day.” It’s not clear whether the letter will actually lead to an investigation. Established under the CARES Act to monitor the spending of pandemic relief funds the PRAC released a report in June warning of delays in processing tax refunds at the IRS and potential fraud in Small Business Administration loans among other issues. However its work may have been stymied early on when Trump removed from his position Glenn Fine an inspector general who had been the PRAC’s chair. According to the New York Times Trump did not give a specific reason for the removal calling it part of a larger reshuffling response to reports of bias among other issues. But Democrats at the time raised concern that Trump was meddling with the oversight panel with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warning that the president was “abusing the coronavirus pandemic to eliminate honest and independent public servants because they are willing to speak truth to power and because he is so clearly afraid of strong oversight.” Meanwhile the Trump administration has defended its response to the Covid-19 crisis. The White House has not responded to Vox’s request for comment for this story but spokesperson Sarah Matthews previously told Vox’s German Lopez that Trump “has led an historic whole-of-America coronavirus response” following expert advice and that “this strong leadership will continue.” The senators’ letter however tells a different story. And whether or not the PRAC ever takes up the call to investigate the document remains an enumeration of the ways the Trump administration appears to have ignored or actively disregarded science and public health and the American people have suffered as a result.

The legacy of Toni Morrison looms large in The Vanishing Half,headline,https://www.vox.com/culture/21377648/vanishing-half-brit-bennett-toni-morrison-oral-tradition-judylyn-ryan,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The Vox Book Club is linking to Bookshop.org to support local and independent booksellers. When I opened up Brit Bennett’s The Vanishing Half for the first time I couldn’t stop thinking about Toni Morrison. Specifically I couldn’t stop thinking about the opening of Beloved (“124 was spiteful. Full of a baby’s venom.”) and how even though it will be hundreds of pages before the ghost of Beloved shows up everything in that opening paragraph tells the reader that the book takes place in a grim and vengeful fairy tale world. The Vanishing Half doesn’t have any full-fledged supernatural elements. But like Beloved it takes place in a world that is not quite straightforwardly real: a world in which every character is the most whatever they are that the world has ever seen; a world in which fates are intertangled in ways that cannot be fought; a world in which the narrator’s voice is elevated rather than conversational and has the cadence of a storyteller sitting by a fire. It opens with Lou LeBon telling his waiting customers the story of the Vignes twins — complete with pauses at the dramatic points as Lou is “a bit of a showman” — and that sense of being verbally told a story continues all the way through the novel. The Vanishing Half takes place within the world of folklore of oral tradition. As part of the Vox Book Club’s month-long discussion of The Vanishing Half I wanted to find out more about how this narrative technique works. So I called up Judylyn Ryan a professor of African American literature at Ohio Wesleyan University and I asked her to tell me all about the place of the oral tradition within the Black literary canon. Together we talked through the way oral traditions work as call and response stories what that means for us as readers and how Toni Morrison changed the way America reads. Our full conversation lightly edited for length and clarity is below. So when I read The Vanishing Half I think “This is not a book that’s trying to be a realist novel.” It’s a book where everyone is defined by their epithets — the two beautiful sisters the darkest girl the lightest girl — and their narrative trajectories are intertwined in ways that feel fated. It reads in many ways like a fairy tale or a folk story. And there’s a similar effect in Bennett’s first book The Mothers which is narrated by a Greek chorus of church ladies. What can you tell me about how African American novels in the past have tended to work with oral traditions? The oral traditions are foundational. Let me start with a good landmark for most readers: Toni Morrison. In the mid-’80s she wrote an essay titled “Rootedness: The Ancestor as Foundation” that laid out why and how the oral tradition is important to her and to any number of other Black writers. She says in that essay that her goal is “to have at my disposal only the letters of the alphabet and some punctuation. I have to provide the places and spaces so that the reader can participate.” This notion of the reader as not just participant which is in itself progressive but the more revolutionary concept of the reader as a co-creator of the text is a principle that is borrowed from the oral tradition. And it becomes an informing philosophy for many African American writers. If you think about it in terms of the larger expanse of the novel as a genre the traditional positioning of the reader has been as an observer right? The writer buries or hides certain meanings in the text and the task of the reader is to find those meanings and then say “I’ve done a good job! I’ve found all of the buried treasures!” That’s not the viewpoint they [Morrison and others writing in her tradition] bring to the work of literary artistry. They see it as the reader is a co-creator of the text much in the tradition of call and response. It’s an essential dynamic of the oral tradition that the listener will eventually become the caller in the next generation. What you have in call and response is a structure a performance dynamic that anticipates and requires that the listener provide a response that may expand challenge revise clarify transform whatever the previous utterance. And they themselves eventually become the new caller. If you take that principle and apply it to literature then you have this vision of the reader as the future caller the co-creator of the meanings possible from the text. The finished novel is itself just a starting point. It’s incomplete. It is a work waiting to be completed by the reader’s engagement. You have a number of literary techniques that can be used to make that participation possible within the work. But that’s what Morrison says in this mid-’80s essay: that her goal is to take this sensibility this opportunity that attends the oral tradition and to make it available in literature. One of the more prominent authors to work with this tradition recently was Marlon James who wrote Black Leopard Red Wolf. He is very committed to the idea that pulling from an oral tradition is part of a rejection of the idea of a coherent stable reality. He said something like “The African folktale is not your refuge from skepticism.” Is that sense of multiple realities and instability traditionally part of how this technique is understood? Multiple possibilities I would say. And once you say possibilities you imply freedoms but also responsibilities. To be in a community means to have the responsibility of expanding the growth and future survival of that community. Which requires creative commitment creative competencies. And those competencies have to be instilled. They have to be taught they have to be developed and you have to make room to practice those competencies. The notion is that artistic expressions in their variety — not just the novel but also the poetry the sermon the dance and so forth — must have this as a primary commitment: authorizing the creative competency of all participants. Not just the main performer. A lot of the canonical African American literature that makes it onto school syllabi and I’m thinking of books by Richard Wright especially here exists in a space more of social realism. What does the conversation between these two literary projects look like? Once you talk about Richard Wright you bring us back to a moment before what I see as the healing of a bifurcation in the artistic tradition. For some obvious reasons oral traditions were not given the kinds of respect the kinds of valuation by the mainstream literary establishment [that the realist novel was]. So you see a break in the tradition between the writers who were very comfortable were very confident of the value of those aesthetics — people like Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes — and people who on the other hand had a much different orientation. Richard Wright was the most renowned the most credentialed the most authoritative of those writers. That bifurcation has now healed itself with the career and the achievements of Toni Morrison. As a matter of fact I think that American readers would not accept or would not have accepted as wholeheartedly the kind of narrative choices that you see in Bennett’s work without Morrison’s career. Is there anything else that you think is really essential to this tradition that you think people should know about? I think Bennett is doing something really interesting in the way in which she builds her discursive authority. I hesitate to use some of the terms we scholars use because I know everyday readers of literature don’t want to be bothered about it but I think it’s helpful here! What she uses is what I would call an ideal narrative audience. That becomes important for Black writers in particular because of the history of discursive authority attaching itself most frequently to writers who are white and male. So Black women writers end up in an impoverished position in that economy and having to use different techniques to accrue authority. One of those techniques is the positioning within the text of an ideal narrative audience: an audience that accepts the writer’s intellectual judgment the writer’s aesthetic value the writer’s credibility. It’s interesting the idea of the writer creating or positioning this ideal narrative audience at the same that they’re asking the audience to help co-create the text. It’s like each participant is creating the next. It might seem at first contradictory but really it’s not. What the ideal narrative audience does is it clears ideological space. It relocates both the reader and writer beyond the racialized positionings assigned by society. Because according to those positionings a Black woman’s voice carries very little authority. But in the experience of Black women there are spaces where a Black woman’s authority is paramount. So for the artist to bring those spaces within the text is for the artist to clear a space and then map out a space for their own performance. And then they relocate the reader within that space. I love the idea that Bennett is relocating us taking us out of the world and into the one she’s built and then inviting us to co-create her book with her. And so now I am turning things over to you book clubbers. If The Vanishing Half is a novel of call and response then you are the ones responding. You’re the vanished half! How do you feel about the idea of a collaborative reading of this book? How did you respond to the fairy tale structure? Do you see shades of Toni Morrison in Bennett’s work?

Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the gun-toting St. Louis couple, explained,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020-presidential-election/2020/8/24/21398970/mark-patricia-mccloskey-republican-convention-guns-black-lives-matter,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Mark and Patricia McCloskey get to speak at the Republican National Convention on Monday because they waved guns at Black Lives Matter protesters. The St. Louis couple rose to national notoriety in late June when they were captured in viral videos and photos outside their mansion in a gated community pointing a rifle and handgun at peaceful protesters. Since then they have turned into a Rorschach test for where people stand on the Black Lives Matter movement and gun rights in America. The protesters were on their way to St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson’s house to demonstrate against police brutality and systemic racism. When the protesters went into the McCloskeys’ privately owned and operated neighborhood Mark McCloskey came out of his house — shouting at demonstrators that they were on private property and should leave. Shortly after Patricia McCloskey came out aiming a handgun at the protesters. Then Mark McCloskey went to her side holding a rifle. The incident quickly became politically polarized. On the left the McCloskeys were widely seen as villains standing against a crowd of peaceful protesters defending and maintaining a status quo that uses the threat of violence to oppress racial minorities. On the right they were viewed as heroes who empowered by their Second Amendment rights stood against a dangerous movement that’s engaged in rioting and looting over the past few months. A few weeks after the encounter St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner charged the McCloskeys with unlawful use of a gun a low-level felony. “It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner at those participating in nonviolent protest and while we are fortunate this situation did not escalate into deadly force this type of conduct is unacceptable in St. Louis” Gardner said. Republican lawmakers including Gov. Mike Parson and US Sen. Josh Hawley subsequently condemned the charges. The McCloskeys received support from right-wing media outlets such as Fox News and Breitbart. President Donald Trump retweeted a video of the couple. Now the McCloskeys still facing charges will speak at the Republican National Convention. The McCloskeys were charged for unlawful use of a gun On June 28 protesters in St. Louis made their way to Mayor Krewson’s house through Portland Place a privately owned and operated neighborhood. The demonstrators were calling on the mayor to resign after during a Facebook Live video she read the names and addresses of people who wrote to her advocating for police reform — which critics said was doxxing and intimidation. (Krewson later apologized but her office also pointed out that the names and addresses were already public records.) As the demonstrators entered the neighborhood the first house on their right was the McCloskeys’. The couple after seeing the commotion came out with guns telling the demonstrators to leave. Many protesters seemed to ignore them and move along though some remained in front of the McCloskeys’ house recording the couple and in some cases shouting back. St. Louis police investigated the incident leading the local prosecutor Gardner to file charges after finding the McCloskeys exhibited a weapon “in an angry or threatening manner.” Although the felony carries the potential of prison time Gardner has said the couple could go through a diversion program that would put them in community service counseling or another remedial program instead. But Gov. Parson has said he would pardon them. Republican supporters claim the couple did nothing wrong with Missouri’s Castle Doctrine and stand-your-ground laws protecting their rights to defend themselves. According to the McCloskeys they genuinely felt their lives were in danger as protesters approached. “It was about as bad as it can get” Mark McCloskey told local news station KSDK. “I really thought it was storming the Bastille — that we would be dead and the house would be burned and there was nothing we could do about it. It was a huge and frightening crowd.” He added “The only thing that stopped the crowd from approaching the house was when I had that rifle. … It’s the only thing that stemmed the tide.” The McCloskeys claimed the protesters broke through the neighborhood’s gate before charging up to their private property. They and their supporters have cited photos of the gate broken into pieces as proof that the demonstrators violently came through. But an investigation by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch indicated the gate was open before the protesters walked through. The investigation also found that the McCloskeys in a previous lawsuit against their neighborhood trustees knew the gate was in bad shape arguing that the trustees didn’t maintain or repair it. So the gate could have been broken on accident as the protesters walked through not due to an act of violence. The protesters said they were peaceful and respectful. They claimed they remained off the McCloskeys’ property sticking to the street or sidewalk — which is backed by videos of the incident. The police investigation found at least one protester was armed. The investigation also concluded that the protesters said some threatening things to the McCloskeys including “you own a business; your business is gone” “we coming back baby” “you ain’t the only [expletive] with a gun” and “they coming back to your house.” The left and right saw the St. Louis incident very differently Exactly how one interprets these events may come down to a person’s politics and views toward Black Lives Matter and gun rights in the US. In the month before the St. Louis incident Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets nationwide calling for an end to police brutality and systemic racism after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Most of the protests were peaceful. But some particularly during the first week turned violent resulting in rioting and looting. The protests also preceded a spike in murders in some large US cities. While criminologists caution that it’s still not completely clear why there has been a murder spike some pundits and experts have linked the rise in violence to the protests — arguing that the protests led police to back down in a way that let crime spike unabated or that the protests fostered distrust in police leading people to resort to their own means outside the law to resolve disputes with others. In this context the McCloskeys’ actions can be interpreted in one of two ways: They’re heroes who stood up against a mob that fostered violence nationwide. Or they’re villains who have mischaracterized an almost entirely peaceful movement in a thinly veiled attempt to maintain a racist status quo that enables unchecked police brutality. Democrats and others on the left have by and large come out against the McCloskeys’ actions. They argue that Black Lives Matter protesters have a real grievance — with the statistical and empirical evidence demonstrating racial disparities in policing and the criminal justice system — despite a very small minority taking part in rioting looting and other violence. To the extent the protests may have contributed to a spike in crime and murders supporters argue that only shows the need for police to repair community trust and relations so they can do their jobs and keep people safe. As former Vice President Joe Biden the Democratic nominee for president put it following Floyd’s killing “We know the nation we want to be. Now we have to deliver on this moment to achieve fundamental changes that address racial inequalities and white supremacy in our country.” Republicans and others on the right have come out in support of the McCloskeys. They’ve claimed the Black Lives Matter movement is trying to defund and abolish the police and pull back “tough on crime” policies that they believe have kept America safe. They’ve also characterized the protests as hypocritical because they’re focused on police violence against Black people but not “Black-on-Black crime.” That’s the context in which Trump during Black Lives Matter protests has repeatedly tweeted “LAW & ORDER!” It’s the same context in which Mark McCloskey told KSDK “There is mayhem in the city every night and you never hear about it.” The protesters counter that they do care about non-police violence — and in fact there have been large Black-led protests over other kinds of violence over the past few years. They argue that police violence against Black people and other kinds of violence are dual problems: Police not only harass and kill Black people but also fail to protect Black people from real crimes. To that end many supporters of Black Lives Matter — Biden included — don’t want to defund or abolish the police but rather reform police to better protect and serve minority communities. Beyond Black Lives Matter the couple’s actions exposed divides over gun rights in the US. For the left the couple’s actions exemplified the kind of reckless loose use of firearms that’s fueled extraordinary levels of gun violence in the US for decades. For the right the moment showed why the Second Amendment and gun rights are necessary — offering a last line of defense when the government can’t or won’t protects its citizens. Together all of these partisan divides have created a political environment in which the McCloskeys are invited to speak at the Republican convention.

Jacob Blake speaks out about being shot by a police officer: "It’s nothing but pain",headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/9/6/21425025/jacob-blake-speaks-out-shot-seven-times-protests,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Reclining in a hospital bed Jacob Blake addressed being shot seven times by a Kenosha Wisconsin police officer in late August for the first time Saturday night. In a video posted on Twitter by his family’s lawyer civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump Blake spoke about the constant pain he experiences due to the shooting which left him paralyzed from the waist down. “I got staples in my back staples in my damn stomach” Blake said. “You do not want to have to deal with this shit man — 24 hours ... it’s nothing but pain.” He added that even basic tasks like eating and sleeping hurt him. “There’s a lot more life to live out here man. Your life — and not only just your life your legs something that you need to move around and move forward in life — can be taken from you like this man” he said with a snap of his fingers. And he ended the short message by urging his supporters to action in order to ensure they don’t experience his pain firsthand. “Please I’m telling you. Change your lives out there” Blake said. “We can stick together make some money make everything easier for our people out there. Because there’s so much time that’s been wasted.” Blake was shot by white Kenosha police officer Rusten Sheskey on the evening of August 23. Police were responding to a domestic incident in which a woman said her “boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises.” Multiple witnesses have said Blake was trying to break up a verbal dispute between two women. Three officers arrived initially including Sheskey. The shooting that followed went viral due to two videos showing officers attempting to force Blake to the ground and later Blake attempting to enter a gray van before Sheskey shoots him seven times. The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into Blake’s shooting which occurred amid ongoing unrest across the country. Blake’s shooting — and the recent killings of other Black men — have stoked ongoing protests The videos reinvigorated nationwide protests against police brutality which have been ongoing for months after the killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville and George Floyd in Minneapolis. Multiple nights of uprisings followed in Kenosha during which buildings were set on fire and police and protesters clashed. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers called in the state National Guard on the second night. On the third night a white teenager who had proclaimed his support for police on social media shot three people killing two. Protests against police brutality have been unfolding in US cities almost daily since Floyd’s death in Minneapolis in late May. Some of those have turned into full-on uprisings involving conflict between protesters and police looting and the burning of buildings and cars. And they continued over Labor Day weekend quickened by the police killings of Deon Kay in Washington DC on September 2; Dijon Kizzee in Los Angeles on August 31; and the release of new video of Daniel Prude’s killing in Rochester New York. On Saturday hundreds protested in Louisville — the city in which Breonna Taylor was killed — ahead of the Kentucky Derby. Counter-protesters came into contact with the protesters near the city’s Metro Hall leading to tense confrontations but no violence. Members of both groups were seen carrying firearms. Black Lives Matter protesters marched to Churchill Downs where the derby was taking place. The evening ended with outdoor dancing in at least one corner of the city. In Rochester New York demonstrators gathered to protest Prude’s death by suffocation. In March police put a hood over Prude’s head and pressed his face to the ground for two minutes. Around 1500 people marched Saturday evening calling for the resignation of city leaders. They faced off with police outside City Hall and some reportedly began throwing rocks and fireworks at police officers who fired tear gas and pepper balls back. In Washington DC Kay’s aunt addressed protesters telling them “The officer that shot Deon him and Deon had a problem with each other. He never liked Deon or the young boys that be down there on Mellon Street” and saying her nephew likely spent his final moments “afraid.” Several hundred people marched throughout the city including near the site of Kay’s death and near the White House demanding greater transparency from leaders and police reforms. In Portland Oregon — where a Trump rally led to clashes between the president’s supporters and protesters as well as the shooting of a right-wing activist — protests began calmly. Later in the evening a group of around 500 protesters marching toward a police precinct were met with officers who declared it a riot. Police released tear gas and shot rubber bullets and a protester threw a Molotov cocktail which police said hit another demonstrator. While the deaths of Taylor Floyd Kay Prude and others are memorialized by protests the underlying issue of inequities in policing continue as Vox’s Aaron Ross Coleman has written. Since Taylor was killed in mid-March at least 83 other Black people have been killed by police according to data compiled by the Washington Post. Other organizations like Mapping Police Violence estimate that number is even higher. And while more white Americans are killed by police annually Black Americans face an outsized number of deaths compared to their population. Black people are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans. Almost no police killings result in officers charged with a crime according to Mapping Police Violence. That’s one thing the massive civil rights movement unfolding across the country seeks to change.

What it’s like working at the polls in the middle of a pandemic,headline,https://www.vox.com/21409225/coronavirus-covid-19-election-polls-safety,www.vox.com,1600223579509
With an hour-long video training under my belt including a five-minute segment about pandemic-related precautions I circled the halls of a government building in downtown Austin Texas looking for the polling location where I’d signed up to work. I tried to open just about every door until I realized the building was deserted. When I called various election officials they informed me that typically these types of details were sorted out at in-person trainings before the election but they had been canceled due to Covid-19. It turned out that the other poll workers got lost in the maze of construction en route to the building. We wound up opening at 8:15 am over an hour past our scheduled opening time. My job that July day was to serve as an alternate election judge a role that involves helping the election judge settle any voter issues or disputes at the polling site for a combined primary runoff — postponed from May — and special election. Despite the additional time afforded by the delay as well as an election that typically sees low turnout I witnessed firsthand how the health and safety of both poll workers and voters left much to be desired during this historic pandemic. And now with the 2020 general election fast approaching and Covid-19’s spread showing no signs of slowing there are other factors that highlight why we need to make in-person voting as safe as possible come November. Only 21 percent of Americans live in states that send mail-in absentee ballots to all voters while 22 percent live in states that require a special reason to receive one. On top of all of this the USPS has begun to inform states that it might not even have the capacity to handle such an extraordinary surge in votes by mail. It’s important we learn from the mistakes made during the primaries. The virus has specifically devastated Texas where I was working; the overall death toll has climbed to more than 10000 as of late August. According to a White House report obtained by the Center for Public Integrity on the day of the election I worked the state was in the red zone for both Covid-19 cases meaning it had more than 100 new cases per 100000 population the previous week and for test positivity meaning more than 10 percent of diagnostic test results came back positive. Against this backdrop poll workers like myself who volunteer to assist voters are crucial to a functional election. But this year perhaps unsurprisingly many volunteers simply did not show up. Three out of the seven poll workers at my location for undisclosed reasons did not attend and prior to Election Day 25 poll workers from Travis County had dropped out while another six to eight did not show. It is not hard to see why poll workers might be so fearful of health consequences that they would back out at the last minute. Our group of poll workers consisted of three men younger than 30 and one woman in her 50s. Considering 58 percent of poll workers in the 2018 general election were over 60 years old our polling site’s age demographic surprised me. In talking with the younger poll workers they explained a mix of patriotic duty and simply lockdown boredom as reasons for signing up. For three of us it was the first election we had ever worked while the other had a week’s worth of early voting experience. On voting day it became clear that it was a good thing so many of us were in a lower-risk age group. I assumed basic preventive measures would be implemented to ensure poll workers were not carrying the virus and infecting voters or each other. While poll workers were required to wear masks there was no testing and no temperature checks and workers weren’t asked any questions regarding symptoms. We also received no protocol on how to handle a sick voter. In terms of PPE we were provided with an array of cleaning supplies face shields and finger cots along with instructions on how to use each item. Then there were the voters themselves. In-person voting makes it difficult to implement critical preventive efforts for voters and poll workers as it risks infringing on voting rights (i.e. turning away voters for not wearing a mask or running a fever). But our team of poll workers started the day with a pact that we would be honest with each other if someone was doing something that made others uncomfortable like taking off their mask indoors. In an effort to maximize safety for voters we set up a check-in line with spots 6 feet apart used the entirety of our massive meeting room space to keep voting machines separate and designed a clear entry-exit flow to ensure minimal contact between voters. We were lucky. Every voter wore a mask and seemed oddly accustomed to being inside with groups of people. This sentiment likely had to do with our site which was in an office building complex and catered to people who were probably more used to the Covid-19 protocols of working in-person. But not every location is like that. The Wisconsin State Journal reported a mix of mask-wearing compliance at its April election after voters were encouraged but not required to wear them. Following the election different studies have shown different risk levels of in-person voting and the spread of the virus in the state. The current rule of thumb seems to be that spreading happens with interactions longer than 15 minutes. At our site most folks were in and out quickly but a handful had issues with their voter registration and spent 30 to 45 minutes in the room. Despite all these risks voter turnout among Democrats has broken records in 2020. Texas offers a perfect example of a state that despite restrictive mail-in voting saw increased voting this year. In an election where only Democrats had a statewide primary runoff for the US Senate candidate facing Republican Sen. John Cornyn the party reported its highest turnout in years with 5.8 percent of registered voters casting votes — more than double the amount cast in the 2018 runoff. So far the pandemic does not appear to be dissuading voters from showing up. As we gear up for the presidential election of 2020 officials need to be thinking more about how to safely protect poll workers in the middle of a pandemic. Election commissions should amplify existing measures such as giving people the option to vote from their car — or curbside voting — which has been expanded in several states. (Texas did expand curbside voting as well though no voters requested this at our site.) Additionally they should heavily recruit less vulnerable populations such as college students and younger service industry employees who have lost jobs due to the pandemic. Finally increased training and communication will be highly important. In all likelihood many poll workers will be inexperienced so providing a detailed outline of what their roles entail and pairing them with experienced workers when possible will be crucial to minimizing wait times at polling sites and in turn decreasing exposure. After that primary election I inquired about testing to see if my day working the polls had resulted in an infection. Travis County Elections informed me they wouldn’t be able to provide help in getting access to testing something I had hoped to do before visiting my parents the following week. At the time Texans across the state were reporting extremely long wait times for tests and delays getting results back so I was nervous. I did manage to find a testing location where I was lectured by the nurse about the exposure risks of pole dancing. Apparently I needed to be more specific than “poll working” — a role that also warrants a conversation about exposure risks.

17-year-old charged with murder in Kenosha, Wisconsin, shootings,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/8/26/21402951/kyle-rittenhouse-jacob-blake-kenosha,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Kyle Rittenhouse a 17-year-old self-identified militia member has been arrested and charged with murder in the fatal shooting of at least two people in Kenosha Wisconsin. Rittenhouse is also suspected of injuring another person at the Tuesday evening protests over the police shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse who has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide left Wisconsin after the shooting and was arrested in his hometown of Antioch Illinois a town 30 minutes away from Kenosha. According to video on social media Rittenhouse was one of several armed men who said they were guarding a gas station in downtown Kenosha on Tuesday night. (Wisconsin is an open carry state but those who carry guns in public must be at least 18.) The scene at the gas station became tense as the armed men clashed with protesters according to the New York Times. Video of the incident shows a man alleged to be Rittenhouse running down the street with an AR-15-style rifle as he’s pursued by others attempting to apprehend him. Rittenhouse falls to the ground then turns around and begins shooting at the people trying to disarm him. After the shooting the man with the rifle walks away from the scene toward law enforcement in armored vehicles according to a video viewed by Kenosha News. In the video a bystander frantically yells to the officers that the man with the rifle shot someone. “Hey he just shot them” the man screams. However law enforcement officials drive directly past the man with the gun. According to a press release from the Kenosha police the shots were fired at 11:45 pm. The gunshot victim who did not die was taken to a hospital with “serious but non-life threatening injuries.” At a Wednesday afternoon press conference police officers did not release the names of the victims but said that a 26-year-old Silver Lake resident and a 36-year-old Kenosha resident died; a 26-year-old West Allis resident was injured. Police said the investigation being led by the Kenosha police and the FBI has not yet determined whether both deaths are connected to Rittenhouse. The shootings took place during the third night of unrest in Kenosha where Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to enforce the city’s curfew. On Monday he called in 125 members; by Tuesday that number grew to 250. On Wednesday Evers said that 500 members of the Wisconsin National Guard would be deployed in Kenosha that evening. Evers responded to the shootings on Wednesday afternoon. “My heart breaks for the families and loved ones of the two individuals who lost their lives and the individual who was injured last night in Kenosha. We as a state are mourning this tragedy” he tweeted. “I want to be very clear: we should not tolerate violence against any person. I’m grateful there has already been swift action to arrest one person involved. The individual or individuals whose actions resulted in this tragic loss of life must be held accountable.” What we know about the shooting suspect According to the Daily Beast Rittenhouse is a committed police supporter. His Facebook page which is no longer publicly accessible displayed “numerous photos with Blue Lives Matter-style pro-police slogans and imagery as well as of an Armalite rifle similar to the one he appears to have been photographed carrying in Kenosha.” In addition a 2018 post on Rittenhouse’s page shows that he asked his followers to donate to the police advocacy nonprofit organization Humanizing the Badge on his birthday. “I’ve chosen this nonprofit because their mission means a lot to me and I hope you’ll consider contributing as a way to celebrate with me” Rittenhouse wrote. The 17-year-old was also in the front row at a Trump rally earlier this year according to BuzzFeed. On January 30 Rittenhouse posted a TikTok video from the Des Moines Iowa rally which showed that he was seated to the left of the president just feet away. His social media accounts also show that he’s an avid Trump supporter and connected to law enforcement in real life as a former member of the Lindenhurst Grayslake Hainesville Police Department’s Public Safety Cadet Program a program that trains young people interested in law enforcement careers. Other social media posts viewed by BuzzFeed show that Rittenhouse had access to at least two types of guns an AR-15-style rifle and what he identifies as a 12-gauge shotgun in one video. In a press conference on Wednesday afternoon Kenosha Sheriff David G. Beth said he received a call from someone on Tuesday requesting that the police department “deputize citizens who have guns to come out and patrol the city of Kenosha.” Beth said he believes Rittenhouse was part of the group of armed men who wanted the department to deputize them. Beth also responded to the concern that police officers did not apprehend Rittenhouse when he walked past them. “I’ve been in a shooting before. In situations that are high-stress you have such incredible tunnel vision. You have no idea what’s outside right here if you’re looking right here” Beth said holding his hands up to gesture. At the press conference a reporter also asked why law enforcement officials were throwing water bottles out of Bearcats to the armed men seemingly encouraging their presence as seen in a viral video. “Our deputies would toss a water to anybody” Beth responded. And to a question about whether the militia increased the tension on the streets Tuesday night Beth said “To some people it may have been calming. To me it’s not.” Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian meanwhile said that he does not want militia members to show up. “I don’t need more guns on the street in the community when we are trying to make sure we keep people safe” he said. “Law enforcement is trained. They’re the ones who are responsible. They’re the ones we have faith will do their job and make sure it gets done. That is why the curfews are there.” On Wednesday afternoon President Trump expressed a desire to bring “law and order” to Wisconsin and “not stand for looting arson violence and lawlessness on American streets.” He has not spoken publicly about the police shooting of Blake. Kenosha officials were expecting another night of unrest after the 7 pm curfew following Rittenhouse’s arrest and as Blake who is reportedly paralyzed from the waist down is treated for injuries to his spine and kidneys at a Milwaukee hospital.

Trump, Biden, and the war over American masculinity,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/8/28/21403866/trump-rnc-speech-biden-covid-19-2020,www.vox.com,1600223579509
When voters decide between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden this November they’ll be choosing between two parties two histories and two very different visions of America. They’ll also be deciding between two versions of masculinity. Trump has made a certain kind of stereotypical manliness core to his campaign ever since 2016. He bragged about his penis size during one debate physically invaded Hillary Clinton’s space during another and repeatedly insulted his opponents’ “toughness” “energy” and “stamina.” Such behavior continued through his presidency and has defined his response to the Covid-19 pandemic during which he has claimed the virus will go away on its own called on Americans to be “warriors” by reopening the economy and routinely refused to wear a mask. In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night — delivered before a largely mask-free crowd — he again used the language of war boasting that “we will crush the virus” and claiming that his opponent’s plan on the crisis “is not a solution to the virus but rather a surrender.” He also yet again demanded that states open their economies despite hundreds of daily deaths saying “they have to be open they have to get back to work.” Trump has also long used the public health crisis as an opportunity to ramp up his xenophobic rhetoric by using a racist name for the virus — something he did again in his convention speech. These bigoted and aggressive comments are part of his larger performance of masculinity some say. “He has conflated his being a man with being a racist” William Ming Liu a professor of counseling higher education and special education at the University of Maryland College Park who studies masculinity told Vox in an email. Biden at least during his 2020 campaign has set out to show voters a different kind of masculinity — and to subtly attack Trump’s. In campaign appearances and at last week’s Democratic National Convention he’s cast himself as “a dependable serious protector” and is “contrasting that to Trump’s brute-force reckless approach” Kristin Kobes Du Mez a history professor at Calvin University who has studied white evangelicals’ views of masculinity told Vox. In his speech at the convention for example Biden called Trump “a president who takes no responsibility refuses to lead blames others cozies up to dictators and fans the flames of hate and division.” And he offered voters instead his vision of America: “one that is generous and strong selfless and humble.” “It’s an America we can rebuild together” he promised. As the campaign continues and the two candidates debate each other the conflict between their two brands of masculinity will surely be thrown into even higher relief. And Americans — who don’t have the option of a female candidate this time around — will have to decide what kind of man they want in the White House in 2021. Trump embodies a particular form of militant masculinity For Trump masculinity has always been about aggression: insulting other people threatening other countries and even attempting to display toughness in the face of a viral threat that can’t actually be vanquished by physical force. It’s a kind of macho posturing that taps into trends in the American electorate that existed even before 2016 according to Du Mez. Starting in the early 2000s a “militant testosterone-driven vision of Christian manhood” began to take hold in evangelical circles she said — one that “condoned violence in the pursuit of righteousness” as well as vulgar language and sexism. “It was a real kind of backlash against feminism against the emasculation of American men” Du Mez said. Trump’s 2016 campaign played right into these ideas. Evangelical voters “talk about him as their ultimate fighting champion as their strongman” Du Mez said. Even comments like those caught on the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump bragged about his ability to grab women “by the pussy” weren’t necessarily an issue for a voting bloc usually concerned with family values. After all “a militant patriarchy is a part of family values politics” Du Mez said with voters seeing Trump’s comments as just another example of his rugged testosterone-fueled manliness. Indeed Trump won an overwhelming 77 percent of white evangelical votes in 2016 with just 16 percent going to Clinton. And it’s not just evangelicals. Over time the embrace of militant masculinity has “created bonds across religious differences” between Christian and secular conservatives Du Mez said. “They’re similarly looking to a kind of pre-feminist or feminist-backlash retrograde masculinity as the antidote to all that ails the country today.” Trump’s approach may also appeal to a wide swath of white Americans who perceive masculinity — specifically white masculinity — to be under attack. “As communities of color demonstrate and as communities of color become more visible and prominent white communities regard this visibility as a threat to the traditional and expected ways of being” Liu said. “And being a white man is embedded within this traditional way of being.” The president’s responses to uprisings around the country in the wake of the police shootings of George Floyd Jacob Blake and others this year have spoken directly to those who see whiteness and specifically white masculinity being threatened. In May for example he called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs” and warned “when the looting starts the shooting starts” (his tweet was marked by Twitter as “glorifying violence”). His “demonstrations of authoritarianism are in a way a wish fulfillment of how white people want to treat race and racism” Liu said — by forcing other groups into submission. This worldview was on display Thursday night as Trump painted a dark picture of “anarchists agitators rioters looters and flag-burners” terrorizing American cities. “No one will be safe in Biden’s America” he proclaimed before demanding that “we have to give law enforcement our police back their power.” “What we can never have in America — and must never allow — is mob rule” the president continued. Trump’s rhetoric and behavior around Covid-19 have also played into ideals of militant tough-guy masculinity. In particular his refusal to wear a mask became part of a larger message that ignoring the risks of the coronavirus was the tough or strong thing to do. And despite warnings from public health experts about the dangers of reopening the country too early he said during a public appearance in May that “the people of our country should think of themselves as warriors” because “our country has to open.” He made that statement at a mask factory in Arizona — where he appeared without a mask. Trump has since said Americans should wear masks admitting that “they have an impact.” But he has continued to appear in public without a mask including at first lady Melania Trump’s speech in the White House Rose Garden on Tuesday night also attended by about 70 mostly maskless audience members and at Vice President Mike Pence’s speech on Wednesday after which he reportedly greeted maskless attendees. In his speech Thursday Trump repeatedly described Covid-19 as an adversary his administration was bravely vanquishing. “In recent months our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy” Trump told his audience. “Like those brave Americans before us we are meeting this challenge” he assured them. “We will defeat the virus end the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before.” For Trump Covid-19 is a war and one he’s already won or is just about to win — even though more than 180000 people have died. In his 2020 campaign Biden is trying to show another path Biden has occasionally sought to present the kind of aggressive masculinity Trump favors. In a 2018 speech referencing Trump’s comments on the Access Hollywood tape for example he said that if the two were high school classmates “I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.” And while Biden has never been known for public vulgarity or insults the way Trump is he has been accused of disrespectful and boundary-crossing behavior with women — and by one woman of sexual assault. Biden has denied the assault allegation and in response to others pledged to change his behavior in response to changing “social norms.” But in the past at least according to some he hasn’t always been a model of healthy masculinity. More recently however as he seeks to present himself as an alternative to Trump in every way he’s also offered a different archetype of manliness. For example he’s “embracing that men can have emotions” Du Mez said. “His campaign is really foregrounding his own loss” — the deaths of his first wife and infant daughter and later of his son Beau — “and then suggesting that he is better equipped to be president perhaps especially in this moment because he has endured such loss.” In her speech at the Democratic National Convention for instance Jill Biden framed her husband’s perseverance in the face of personal tragedy as evidence of his strength — and preparation for carrying the nation through the tragedy of Covid-19. “The burdens we carry are heavy and we need someone with strong shoulders” she said. “I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe he will do for your family what he did for ours: Bring us together and make us whole carry us forward in our time of need keep the promise of America for all of us.” In her words Biden became not the militant aggressive macho-man exemplified by Trump but the powerful yet benevolent father figure America needs right now. Biden has painted a similar picture of himself in recent months. In his speech at the Democratic convention he delivered a message of empathy to those who have lost loved ones in the pandemic. “I know how it feels to lose someone you love” he said. “I know that deep black hole that opens up in your chest. That you feel your whole being is sucked into it. I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes.” Trump too mentioned those who have lost their lives to Covid-19 noting “many Americans have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease.” But moments later he was referring to the virus in racist terms while bragging about his successful war against it. And Biden didn’t just empathize — he also pledged to shield Americans from future threats saying “I will protect America. I will defend us from every attack. Seen and unseen. Always. Without exception. Every time.” And he accused Trump of failing to do the same. “The president keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear” Biden said. “He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well I have news for him no miracle is coming.” And he argued “Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation. He failed to protect us. He failed to protect America.” In essence Biden didn’t just offer a different more benevolent form of masculinity from Trump. He also essentially accused Trump of failing at masculinity — of being a bad protector an irresponsible steward of the country and a shirker who keeps waiting for a miracle rather than doing the hard work of keeping people safe. “There are many different ways that masculinity is imagined” Du Mez says. There’s Trump’s macho reckless version and then there are “models of masculinity that prioritize self-restraint stoicism and not whining about things.” In his speech Biden essentially called out Trump for failing to live up to some of those other models — for shifting blame failing to take responsibility and ultimately for being weak in the face of a challenge that demands emotional as well as physical strength. Calling Trump weak in this subtler way may be a smarter move politically than talking about beating him up. The Republican primary in 2016 was a reminder that when other candidates try to match Trump with tough talk “Trump ends up winning on that particular turf because he has no restraint” Du Mez said. And if he sticks to presenting himself as a benevolent empathetic protector figure Biden will certainly offer voters a clear alternative to Trump’s chest-beating — as well as a different model for young people of how a powerful man can behave. “He expresses genuine joy and laughter when he is with other people he has a sense of humor about himself he expresses warmth with his wife he shows caring for his children and he has empathy for others’ joy happiness and pain” Liu said. “His openness to his emotions as well as his emotional connection to others informs his intellect and his decisions.” Of course it’s also telling that the 2020 election is still a contest between masculinities with two older white men duking out over who would be a better patriarch for the country. In a way the real broadening of America’s ideas of masculinity may have to come later when (and if) whoever is president next chooses to share power with others and ultimately passes the torch to them. Biden has gestured toward this moment when he speaks of other leaders in America and in his campaign — most notably Sen. Kamala Harris his running mate who once strongly challenged him on issues of systemic racism. Harris “is a powerful voice for this nation” Biden said in his speech last week. “Her story is the American story.” But the story of America has largely been written by men like Biden. And his biggest opportunity to model new kinds of masculinity for the future may come in the ways he chooses to let others take the lead.

Trump responds to a deadly shooting in Portland by blaming Democrats,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/8/30/21407435/trump-tweets-deadly-shooting-portland-democrats-national-guard,www.vox.com,1600223579509
One person was killed in Portland Oregon on Saturday after supporters of President Donald Trump led a caravan into the city — and instead of trying to deescalate tensions Trump spent Sunday on Twitter threatening to send in the National Guard. Among a slew of other missives the president retweeted a message calling for Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler to resign and tiptoed right up to the edge of endorsing violence saying a video showing his supporters unleashing paintballs and pepper spray on Portland residents — and at least one journalist — reflected that escalating unrest “cannot be unexpected ... The people of Portland won’t put up with no safety any longer.” Notably absent from his tweets: Any kind of condemnation of violence on the part of his supporters who he referred to as “GREAT PATRIOTS” and any call for peace or deescalation. The tweets — Trump’s initial response to news of the shooting ahead of a visit to his golf course in Virginia — reflect an extraordinary abdication of responsibility on the part of the president after the second spate of deadly violence at a protest in less than a week. In a number of his tweets and retweets Sunday Trump dismissed arguments that he is responsible for ending violence at protests claiming instead that deadly incidents are the fault of Democratic mayors and governors. For example the president amplified a tweet accusing Democrats of “being slow and hesitant to condemn violence and disorder” and also one that accused Wheeler and the Portland police of having “blood on their hands.” “Disgraceful Anarchists” he wrote in reply to a video of Portland protesters. “We are watching them closely but stupidly protected by the Radical Left Dems!” And it is a message that has been articulated by a number of Trump surrogates in recent days. Blaming Democrats for violence and unrest was a recurring theme at the Republican National Convention last week and again on Meet the Press Sunday morning where White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows claimed that while Trump “does govern and lead the entire country ... it’s not Donald Trump that is saying ‘Let’s look the other way.’ It’s the mayor of Portland.” Meadows’s claim about Wheeler isn’t accurate. In a letter to Trump Friday the Portland mayor condemned violence in no uncertain terms writing that “there is no place for looting arson or vandalism in our city. There is no room here for racist violence or those who wish to bring their ideology of hate into our community.” And at a press conference Sunday Wheeler called the president’s tweets “appalling.” Speaking directly to Trump he said “It’s you who have created the hate and the division ... you want me to stop the violence that you helped create. What America needs is for you to be stopped.” Following Wheeler’s address Trump tweeted what appeared to be a response calling Wheeler the “wacky Radical Left Do Nothing Democrat Mayor of Portland” and writing that when it comes to a federal response in Portland the mayor “hasn’t seen anything yet.” With an election looming this sort of rhetoric from the president has become commonplace; in fact Trump and his allies appear poised to make ongoing protests — and rising violence — a central focus of his reelection campaign. Violence as a reelection strategy Though shocking by any measure Trump’s response Sunday isn’t that surprising. The president and his supporters have been forthright about their view on violence in the streets with some like senior adviser to the president Kellyanne Conway openly stating they believe the violence helps them politically — and that they’re not interested in calming things down. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson made as much clear on CNN’s State of the Union Sunday in an interview with Dana Bash. Johnson a staunch Trump supporter not only refused to condemn Trump’s “agitating” in Portland but also equivocated on the shooting deaths of two people during protests in Kenosha Wisconsin. (A 17-year-old Trump supporter was charged with murder in connection with the killings.) “I’m not for vigilantism” Johnson said. “I’m not sure that’s what was happening ... people took matters into their own hands.” Even before Kenosha and Portland the GOP and Trump have worked to advance a narrative that violence against protesters is at worst self-defense. For example the Republican National Convention last week featured — and valorized — Mark and Patricia McCloskey a pair of St. Louis lawyers who are both facing felony charges after they menaced Black Lives Matter protesters passing in front of their house with guns. A law and order message doesn’t work when you’re the chaos candidate Just because Trump and his team believe that chaos and violence in the streets of major US cities is good for them doesn’t mean it’s true. In fact polling suggests it could be just the opposite. Ahead of the recent rash of protests — as well as the shooting of Jacob Blake by a police officer in Kenosha Wisconsin that set them off — a Yahoo!/YouGov poll found that 48 percent of Americans view Trump as “the source of the chaos” and only 21 percent of Americans believe he can or will protect them from the chaos. Even among Republicans Trump’s numbers don’t look great — just 51 percent believe Trump will protect them from the chaos. It’s important to note that this poll was taken from August 21 to 23 before the latest protests and violence escalated. But a more recent poll taken from August 28 to 29 by ABC News/Ipsos found 59 percent of Americans disapproved of the Republican message at the GOP’s convention which again focused heavily on America being in chaos due to Democratic mismanagement — and that 62 percent saw Blake’s shooting as part of a broader problem in how Black Americans are treated by law enforcement. The concerns suggested by this polling underscore an important reality: All the unrest happening in the US right now which Trump has gleefully painted in apocalyptic terms as the country’s future should Democratic nominee Joe Biden win in November is happening on Trump’s watch not Biden’s. And although Portland and other cities experiencing violence and unrest are indeed led by Democrats it’s hard to see what a Trump reelection could do to suddenly bring calm to the country given they would likely remain under Democratic leadership during a second Trump term. But with the economy in the midst of recession the coronavirus running rampant and Trump some 8.8 percentage points behind Biden in FiveThirtyEight’s national polling average Trump remains in need of a broadly persuasive reelection pitch with less than 70 days until the election. If his tweets Sunday are any guide Trump has recently found a message he likes — whether or not it works — and he’s sticking with it.

The killing of Daniel Prude, explained,headline,https://www.vox.com/21428830/killing-of-daniel-prude-explained-defund-abolish-police,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The release of video of the killing of Daniel Prude a 41-year-old Black man in Rochester New York is raising new questions about the use of law enforcement as ad hoc mental health specialists in light of calls to reform defund or abolish the police. There is still an ongoing investigation into Prude’s death which has led to the resignation of all of Rochester’s top police officials. Prude was stopped by police on March 23 early on in the coronavirus pandemic after officers responded to a call about a naked man claiming he was infected with Covid-19. He was animated and appeared distressed during his arrest and was ultimately pinned down by officers who’d placed a hood over his head until his cries of distress — and his movements — stopped. The video released in early September displays Prude’s final moments as captured by an officer’s body camera and its delayed release prompted concerns of a cover-up. The video immediately sparked intense protests in Rochester and escalated ongoing anti-police violence protests around the United States with demonstrators taking to the streets in honor of Prude calling for transparency resignations and reforms. Some resignations arrived on September 8 when the command staff and the chief of police La’Ron Singletary retired. Singletary had previously denied accusations of a cover-up writing in his resignation announcement that “as a man of integrity I will not sit idly by while outside entities attempt to destroy my character. The events over the past week are an attempt to destroy my character and integrity.” The New York state attorney general’s office is continuing its investigation into the killing having impaneled a grand jury on September 5. The new information around Prude’s killing comes at the end of a long summer of racial unrest and protest amid a surge of attention to the Black Lives Matter movement. Additionally Prude’s killing places a particular spotlight on activists’ calls to defund the police and invest in new emergency response systems that could respond to mental health crises like the one Prude experienced before his death. What happened to Daniel Prude On March 22 Prude — a Chicago native — traveled to Rochester to visit his older brother Joe Prude. Joe had invited his younger brother in hopes of helping with his mental health issues. On the train Daniel exhibited abnormal behavior according to a Depew Police Department report that described him as “refusing to listen to orders” and “continu[ing] to smoke on the train.” Earlier in the evening preceding his death Prude had been admitted to — and released from — the hospital over concerns he might be experiencing a mental break. By early in the morning on March 23 Daniel slipped out of Joe’s home prompting his older brother to call the police for help. The next time Joe would see Daniel was at the hospital a week later when doctors asked him if he wanted to end life support. It would take the family months of legal work to discover the role police had played in his death. Body camera footage recently released by Prude’s family which were obtained following petitions to the state under freedom of information laws show what happened to Prude. The video taken from several officers’ body cameras begins at 3:16 am. It shows Prude standing naked in the middle of a street wet with snow. He appears in distress but is mostly compliant with police. With a Taser pointed at him Prude follows police commands lying down on the pavement and allowing officers to cuff him. For three minutes Prude makes a variety of statements including thanking the officers asking for gloves and requesting he be allowed to collect money. Officers then placed a mesh “spit hood” over Prude’s head saying they did so out of fears about the coronavirus and their concern Prude might have it; he reportedly told a Rochester resident he did earlier in the night. The hood aggravates Prude and he becomes less compliant offering prayers requesting cigarettes and making pronouncements that officers respond to with laughter. As the snow continues officers place Prude face down on the street applying force from several angles on his back and head to restrain him. Prude begs them to stop. They do not. Shortly after that Prude becomes unresponsive. Officers move his head and discuss the fluid that has issued from his mouth; some laugh. Then officers begin providing medical assistance. Nearly 10 minutes after the interaction began they uncuff him and place him in an ambulance. A paramedic can be heard telling the officers that the drug PCP is why Prude became unresponsive saying “It’s not you guys’ fault. You’ve got to keep yourselves safe.” Prude died a week later on March 30. The Monroe County medical examiner and documents filed along with a lawsuit from Prude’s family describe the events that night as a homicide noting that “complications of asphyxia” and PCP were contributing factors in Prude’s death. Allegations of a cover-up In late April after conducting a review of the body camera footage an investigation by the Rochester Department determined the officers involved had complied with their training and acted appropriately. “Based upon the investigation the officers’ actions and conduct displayed when dealing with Prude appear to be appropriate and consistent with their training” the report concluded according to a legal complaint from Prude’s family. (This legal action filed on September 8 and detailed by local media outlets alleges an “internal cover up that began immediately after the incident.”) For weeks more the family was left in the dark as their private counsel pushed the state to release more information. According to reporting from the New York Times it wasn’t until May 18 after procuring an attorney that the family received the county medical examiner’s report explaining that police had killed Prude. And it wasn’t until July 31 that the family was invited to the state attorney general’s office to view the body camera footage that showed the homicide. Before the family successfully petitioned for the video and documents relating to the killing the Rochester police had classified Prude’s cause of death as a drug overdose. Police told the mayor Lovely Warren that Prude died after taking PCP. Warren cited this misinformation as a contributing factor to the initial creeping pace of the investigation. “Experiencing and ultimately dying from the drug overdose in police custody as I was told by the chief is entirely different than what I ultimately witnessed on the video” the mayor said after the video was published. According to a local news report by WHAM former Police Chief La’Ron Singletary called the mayor to inform her of Prude’s death the day it happened. Singletary denied obscuring the truth. “This is not a cover-up” Singletary said. “Let me be clear when I say that: This is not a cover-up whatsoever.” After the family released the video and demonstrations began officials took much more aggressive action. The day after the video was released seven officers involved in Prude’s arrest were suspended and New York Attorney General Letitia James announced she would launch a grand jury investigation. “The Prude family and the Rochester community have been through great pain and anguish” James said in a statement about Prude’s death noting that the grand jury was a prong in an “exhaustive investigation.” Similarly Rochester City Council President Loretta Scott expressed sympathy for “the anger confusion and betrayal felt by the community”; in another statement Warren apologized for the killing. “Mr. Daniel Prude was failed by our police our mental health care system our society and by me” Warren said during a press conference. “And for that I apologize to the Prude family and all of our community.” The mayor also announced reforms aimed at addressing systemic issues around police officers’ failure to provide assistance to people with mental illness. “We are doubling the availability of mental health professionals” Warren said. “We will take our family crisis intervention team out of the police department and move it and its funding to the department of youth and recreation services.” Within a week of the video’s release Singletary announced he would be stepping down as police chief. He has denied public concerns that he hindered or covered up the investigation arguing that “the mischaracterization and the politicization of the actions that I took after being informed of Mr. Prude’s death is not based on facts and is not what I stand for.” Instead Singletary said he was resigning because “his career and integrity [have] been challenged” by “outside entities.” According to Rochester City Newspaper “The departures included the chief one of his deputies and two commanders as well as the demotions of two other deputy chiefs and another commander and came three days after the state attorney general announced that she would impanel a grand jury to consider evidence in Prude’s death.” Yet the delay in publishing information concerning Prude’s case the initial misclassification of the cause of death and the long-standing inconsistencies in police descriptions of officer killings (for example Laquan McDonald) have caused concern for activists who say the Prude case was a cover-up. “Let’s keep the pressure up until all those responsible for Daniel Prude’s murder and cover up—including Mayor Lovely Warren—have resigned taken responsibility and donated their pensions to the families they allowed to be harmed” Free The People Roc a Rochester racial justice advocacy group wrote on Facebook. “Together we have the ability to hold those in power accountable and bring an end to systemic police violence in our community.” As noted by a popular “how many weren’t filmed” sign seen at Black Lives Matter protests this summer many protesters fear that when there is no hard evidence the police may very well get away with murder. Prude’s case is representative of long-standing problems policing mental health Prude’s killing is part of police departments’ long history of using lethal violence against people with mental illness. According to the Washington Post Fatal Force tracker this year American police officers have killed more than 100 people with mental illness including a 37-year-old Army veteran with a machete in North Carolina an unarmed 20-year-old in a Walmart parking lot in Texas and a 24-year old holding a toy gun in New Jersey. In the five years the Post has been keeping the tracker at least 1254 people with mental illness have been killed by the police — that’s 22 percent of all those killed. Stretching back to the shooting of Eleanor Bumpurs in 1984 if not earlier the killing of people with mental illness has long been a problem for police in New York state. The persistence of this violence highlights one of the key demands of many activists who call for “defunding” police: sending funds to mental health professionals more appropriately trained to respond to mental health crises. As Vox’s Ezra Klein explained on a recent episode of his podcast these activists would like to reimagine emergency response for people with mental illness: The state would have a specific and special competency in like people who knew how to help others with mental health. So when those folks were having a really bad night for them and for others there’d be someone forgiving and gentle and calm — the person you would want to be called out there if it was your sibling with bipolar disorder who had lost the plot and was wandering around. Yet as Prude’s case shows when someone is having a crisis they are all too often met with lethal force rather than with deescalation and expert mental health care. “I placed a phone call for my brother to get help” Joe Prude told reporters. “Not for my brother to get lynched.” Help keep Vox free for all Millions turn to Vox each month to understand what’s happening in the news from the coronavirus crisis to a racial reckoning to what is quite possibly the most consequential presidential election of our lifetimes.

57 years after the March on Washington, people are returning the same spot to protest police violence,headline,https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/8/27/21404259/march-on-washington-2020-explained,www.vox.com,1600223579509
On the granite steps of the Lincoln Memorial are carved two footprints. An inscription notes this spot was where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech in front of thousands on August 28 1963. On Friday amid a summer of protest against systemic racism and police violence remarks will again be delivered from that same place by those speaking out against state violence. Dubbed “Get Your Knee Off Our Necks” the 2020 March on Washington is expected to draw 50000 protesters from around the country. It was announced by Rev. Al Sharpton during the June funeral of George Floyd a Black man who died after a white officer kneeled on his neck for longer than eight minutes. Then this week another nationwide wave of protests broke out after Kenosha Wisconsin police shot 29-year-old Jacob Blake in the back multiple times revitalizing the movement to get out into streets during a time when the physical emotional and economic health of Black Americans has disproportionately been impacted. The march — organized by Sharpton’s National Action Network along with the NAACP the National Urban League the Hispanic Federation clergy groups unions and civil rights groups — will include speeches by Sharpton Martin Luther King III and relatives of those killed by police including Floyd Breonna Taylor Eric Garner and others. After initial criticism from activists over the exclusion of families of local victims of police violence several DC-based family members will also speak. Although organizers initially expected 100000 protesters to attend the day of speeches at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC the district’s coronavirus quarantine travel restrictions ended up cutting that number in half. Residents of nearby Maryland and Virginia are exempt from the district’s quarantine order though and tour buses from several northeastern states like New York and New Jersey are also exempt according to the Washington Post. Several groups from other cities who have been organizing protests throughout the summer like in Louisville and Atlanta are also traveling to attend the rally. To deal with the pandemic everyone attending will be subject to a mandatory temperature check upon entry. Masks will be mandatory in the protest area and anyone seeking to gain entry without one will be provided with a mask. There will also be 20 hand sanitizer stations according to protest organizers. Marchers are expected to starting gathering on the National Mall around the reflecting pool at 7 am Friday and speakers will begin addressing the crowd from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at around 11 am. Prior registration is required for all attendees. For those not able to be there in person the event will be streamed online in full by the NAACP. The “ill-timed” protest against racial injustice that made history This year’s march marks the 57th anniversary of King’s famous speech which was attended by approximately 250000 people. Originally conceived as a protest for jobs the march quickly morphed into a wider protest for racial justice after a summer of police beatings of civil rights activists working against the disenfranchisement of Black voters. While King’s speech is most remembered for his iconic finish in which he laid out his vision for a future of racial equality in the US he also spoke to the urgency of now — a lesson that can apply just as much today as it did back then. “This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism” he said. “Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.” His words still ring true as the country marches in the streets against police brutality. “There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights ‘When will you be satisfied?’ We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality” he said. Activists Philip Randolph Whitney M. Young Jr. and Roy Wilkins spoke at the 1963 march as well as civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) who died last month. In the spring of 1963 as the march was being planned President John F. Kennedy met with organizers and suggested that such a large-scale protest was “ill-timed.” “We want success in the Congress not just a big show at the Capitol” the president told organizers. King responded telling the president: “Frankly I have never engaged in any direct-action movement which did not seem ill-timed.” In a way it’s a direct parallel to this summer’s protests as worried politicos have sometimes fretted that mass protests against police violence could potentially drive more support toward President Donald Trump as he seeks reelection this year. But after his initial hesitancy Kennedy embraced the event. Two months before the march in the wake of the assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers and the resulting race riots Kennedy announced plans for a civil rights bill. It was signed into law the following year by President Lyndon Johnson. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin in several key areas of public life including employment housing and public accommodations. It remains to be seen whether this year’s march will achieve an eventual legislative victory at the federal level. Many of the demands currently being made for defunding the police fall under the jurisdiction of state or local officials but there are some things lawmakers can do federally to address police violence like ending qualified immunity for officers or banning police chokeholds. Federal legislators can also help by providing economic relief especially as the pandemic has taken a significant toll on Black employment. The National Mall and in particular the steps of the Lincoln Memorial has long been an iconic spot for mass protests. In May 1957 25000 protesters gathered there to commemorate the decision in Brown v. Board of Education and to demand the federal government follow through with honoring that decision. Returning to the site of King’s 1963 speech at the end of a summer of national anti-racism protests seems more than fitting.

The night the NBA suddenly stopped,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/8/27/21403891/nba-playoff-games-boycott-bucks-lakers-jacob-blake,www.vox.com,1600223579509
For one night the NBA suddenly stopped. The Milwaukee Bucks who were supposed to have a chance Wednesday to clinch their first-round playoff series against the Orlando Magic didn’t come out on the court for their 4 pm tip-off. The news soon broke: The Bucks were boycotting the game believing they should not play given the recent shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha Wisconsin. Within a matter of hours the entire Wednesday slate of playoff games had been postponed. A summer of racial tension and plague has culminated in some of the world’s best and most famous Black athletes walking out on the job in protest of police violence. The NBA had seemed for the last few weeks like a city on the hill amid the pandemic its Disney World bubble a success story of no infections and exciting basketball. The playoffs had gotten underway with star players like LeBron James Kawhi Leonard and Giannis Antetokounmpo all expecting their teams to compete for a league title. But the protests of the spring and summer after George Floyd’s death were never far from mind. Many of the players had returned hoping to use their platform to amplify racial justice protests: “Black Lives Matter” was written on the court. Players wore jerseys with (league-approved) catchphrases like “Equality” and “Say Her Name” and “Vote” printed on the back. Then Jacob Blake was shot in the back just 45 minutes from Milwaukee and the Bucks decided they couldn’t play in good conscience. Other teams and other leagues soon came to the same conclusion. The games were off at least for one night. “Over the last few days in our home state of Wisconsin we have seen the horrendous video of Jacob Blake being shot in the back seven times by a police officer in Kenosha and the additional shooting of protestors” Sterling Brown a Bucks player who was himself the target of aggressive police behavior in the last few years said on behalf of his team. “Despite the overwhelming pleas for change there have been no actions so our focus cannot be on basketball.” On Thursday the New York Times and ESPN reported NBA players were planning to resume playoffs citing anonymous sources. The competitive and financial pressure to do so is great. But even one night of protest from the league’s stars was an extraordinary moment not only for sports but for American politics. Individual athletes have protested out of political conviction before. And some of them have been ostracized; Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the National Anthem and quickly found himself without a job in the NFL. NBA players have more often been on the leading edge of athlete activism supported by a more progressive league office. But there had still never been anything like Wednesday’s walkout. The players may not have had a specific list of demands but Black scholars I spoke with said the very fact of the work stoppage itself was historically significant. “This is an unprecedented act of collective protest. There is no precedent in sports history” Hasan Jeffries a history professor at Ohio State University told me in an email. “We have reached an inflection point among Black athletes.” What the NBA players accomplished with playoff games walkouts The NBA walkout was it would appear somewhat spontaneous. It became clear something was amiss only when the Bucks did not emerge from their locker room for the start of their game against the Magic. According to Marc Spears of The Undefeated Magic players didn’t know the Bucks players were planning a walkout for the game. Shams Charania of The Athletic reported that it was George Hill a Bucks point guard who first broached the idea of walking out in Milwaukee’s locker room before the game. The league office and team owners were also caught off guard by the Bucks’ decision according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. Milwaukee players who live and work less than an hour from the scenes of the Kenosha Wisconsin shootings and protests — and who themselves have experienced police brutality — appear to have felt an urge to act. They quickly gained the support of their opponents and other teams and in no time at all other leagues. The Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder scheduled to play the next game after Bucks-Magic soon agreed to boycott their game as well. So did the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers who were supposed to play the primetime game on Wednesday night. Fans who might have thought they were tuning in for pregame analysis were instead greeted by some remarkable television with retired player and commentator Kenny Smith walking off the Inside the NBA set in solidarity and former All Star-turned-color analyst Chris Webber offering his heartfelt support for the protesting players. The NBA was shut down. And in a matter of hours the WNBA — where some players like league MVP Maya Moore had already taken dramatic action for racial justice with Moore sitting out the 2019 season to focus on her activism — shut down too. Several Major League Baseball games were canceled Wednesday night as well although others were played. The NHL also played its scheduled playoff games. It all happened fast. And so perhaps it is no surprise that the path forward was unclear. The NBA players did not have any comprehensive set of demands. Nobody was sure how long the work stoppage would last or whether the playoffs would resume at all. The players association met Wednesday night to discuss extending the walkout into a full strike with some teams reportedly voting to leave the Disney World bubble and go back home. It was not until a second players meeting on Thursday that the decision to restart the season was reached. But that doesn’t mean the NBA players didn’t have any idea what to do with their platform. Bucks players spoke by phone to Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. They also gave a statement urging the Wisconsin legislature to reconvene and consider bills on policing reform. By that measure the NBA walkout is already a success. NBA owners hugely wealthy and influential people are tweeting their support for police reform. Even the family of Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos the owners of the Orlando Magic put out a statement “condemning bigotry racial injustice and the unwarranted use of violence by police against people of color.” The day after the walkout the Houston Rockets announced that their arena would be used as an early in-person voting center. Other venues in other cities had already taken the same step but the timing of the Houston news is impossible to ignore; players were urging their teams’ owners to take concrete action in response to their grievances. Black activism has always been characterized by a multi-faceted approach. Regular people who boycotted the Montgomery Alabama bus system during the civil rights era were doing their part. Black celebrities who focus the media’s attention on issues of racial justice[ are playing a different role. “The way Black politics have worked is that there is not one special tactic. There is a utilization of multiple tactics to be successful” Lakeyta Bonnette-Bailey a Georgia State University professor who studies Black politics and culture told me. “The news cycle went off to discuss other things ... Even if it’s a one-time tactic they are showing their solidarity and bringing the media attention to express they are fed up.” Black athletes often use their platforms to protest for racial justice — but never quite like this Black celebrities and athletes specifically have a long history of protest. It reflects the “linked fate” Black Americans feel with one another Bonnette-Bailey told me regardless of their wealth or status. “Black people share a group conscious a linked fate” she said. “What happens to other Black people matters to me.” Many Black individual athletes have put their careers on their line over the years to show support for civil rights and racial justice. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City two Black American sprinters raised a fist on the medal ceremony platform. It was the summer of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination and protests over the Vietnam War. The US athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos had been politically active in their private lives but wanted to use the moment in the public spotlight earned through their athletic success to express their support for human rights. And they paid a real price: US Olympic officials under pressure from the International Olympic Committee banned Smith and Carlos for supposedly “politicizing” the event as Smithsonian magazine recounted in 2008. They came home to death threats; Carlos’s wife later committed suicide and he blames in part the pressure from his notoriety. The NBA as the league for some of the best known individual Black athletes and with an outsized place in Black culture compared to football or baseball has always been a forum for Black activism. Elgin Baylor a star rookie for the Lakers in 1959 boycotted a game in his rookie season after a hotel in West Virginia told the team’s Black players could not stay in the same accommodations as white players. It was something that had happened before earlier that season. Bill Russell the leader of legendary 1960s Boston Celtics teams and some of his black teammates also sat out a game in 1961 after they were also turned away from a hotel while on a road trip. And today professional Black athlete of today are not immune from the same kind of discrimination just because they are successful on the court or the field. Brown was arrested and tasered by some of the city’s police officers in January 2018 after putting his hands in his sweatshirt. He had been stopped in the first place for parking in a handicapped spot before running into a convenience store. New York City agreed to pay then-Atlanta Hawks forward Thabo Sefolosha $4 million in 2017 in a settlement over his wrongful arrest and the use of excessive force by the arresting police officers. After Eric Garner died in a chokehold by a NYPD officer NBA players wore shirts with “I Can’t Breathe” printed on them. At the 2016 ESPY awards top players like James Dwyane Wade Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony appeared in all black to speak about the needs for reform after a summer of shootings and racial tension. James the face of the league has parried with Donald Trump on Twitter since the latter became president and is investing millions of dollars to support voting rights for Black Americans and to hire poll workers for the 2020 election. When Fox News host Laura Ingraham insisted James “shut up and dribble” her words became a rallying cry for players who insisted that they would do no such thing. But there had never been a moment of NBA activism quite like this. The players were reportedly ready to walk out of playoff games in 2014 after leaked audio of then-Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling making racist comments was released. But the league intervened banned Sterling from the NBA for life and ordered him to sell the team thus avoiding the players feeling they needed to walk off to force change. To have the entire league shut down now in the middle of the playoffs meant to salvage a season derailed by Covid-19 is a sign of how seriously the players take the issues they are protesting. “For teams to stand down speaks to the seriousness of their commitment especially during the playoffs ‘enough is enough’ is the message” Jeffries said. “‘We will not entertain while we die.’” The walkout could have serious consequences for the NBA and its players Covid-19 combined with the recent spate of police shootings to make playing untenable for the NBA’s players — and yet the pandemic may have also oddly enough help facilitate such an unusual show of solidarity from star athletes to protesters in the streets. The unrest after George Floyd’s killing had already unsettled the league. Some players wondered whether the NBA should resume its season at all given how important this moment seemed to be for Black activism. Could they do more good at home than on the court? Ultimately the decision was made to set up the Disney World bubble and finish the season in no small part because of the money the league and its players would lose otherwise and because of the platform some players and coaches believed they would have to speak out on political causes they support. Some gestures were made by the league to support those desires such as the custom jerseys with social justice messaging. But no one could have imagined when play resumed in July after having been suspended in March that the players would use their platform to stage a walkout meant to direct the country and the world’s eyes back to the problem of racial injustice. With the players living together in Disney World hotels for weeks on end there was clearly a lot of chatter within teams about how to respond after the news of Jacob Blake being shot by police. Some players started to talk about going home. They settled for now on sitting out at least one game. But that decision did not come without risks. The players were technically violating league rules by refusing to play an action that is supposed to result in in financial penalties. But nobody is sure the league would actually try to fine players for protesting on behalf of racial justice. If the entire season would have been canceled the league would have lost millions upon millions of dollars in TV revenue. The NBA already lost money by canceling games in the spring and it may struggle to regain its financial footing for a while because fans do not appear likely to be attending games in arenas any time soon. Those revenue losses will inform the league salary cap and by extension the pay for players going forward. That is one of the factors players were forced to consider as they debated whether to resume play or not. On-court legacies were at stake in the decision whether or not to play. LeBron James is 35 and with three titles already won has precious few seasons left to match Michael Jordan’s six. The Bucks are currently championship contenders with Antetokounmpo the reigning MVP but the whispers have already begun about whether he would leave without the team having more playoff success. The Los Angeles Clippers and Houston Rockets entered the bubble with title aspirations of their own. The Toronto Raptors hoped for an opportunity to defend their 2019 championship. And in a hyperpolarized political moment the players could risk alienating fans through their political activism. The Athletic’s Ethan Strauss has reported on the NBA’s deteriorating TV ratings over the last decade and he posits at least part of the explanation is fans who do not share the players’ politics have tuned out. Top Trump White House officials like Jared Kushner and Marc Short were dismissive of the players’ protest; Short called it “absurd and silly.” Some people may also be perturbed by what they perceive as inconsistencies in the NBA politics; the league and its players were notably reluctant to criticize China’s policies toward Hong Kong at the beginning of this season. Because of the wavering support at home the league has invested billions of dollars in establishing a presence in China but that requires cooperation with the Chinese government which has cracked down on civil rights in Hong Kong and is holding millions of Muslim Uighur people in detention camps. So this is a fraught moment for the NBA in more ways than one. But if the players’ goal was forcing a conversation about racial justice and police reform they have succeeded. “In one fundamental way it’s already successful in terms of politicizing the athletes themselves. I strongly suspect that we will see more social justice activism from them not less and more from other people drawing inspiration and courage from them. And from a social justice perspective that is a major victory” Jeffries said. “It’s up to us as a society and not them to make change beyond that.” New goal: 25000 In the spring we launched a program asking readers for financial contributions to help keep Vox free for everyone and last week we set a goal of reaching 20000 contributors.

The "Get Your Knee Off Our Necks" March on Washington in photos,headline,https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/8/29/21406686/get-your-knee-off-our-necks-march-on-washington-photos,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Fifty-seven years after Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the 1963 March on Washington thousands of protesters for racial justice again gathered on the National Mall in Washington DC. It was an emotional day of protesting against police violence the culmination of a summer of nationwide protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Rev. Al Sharpton who first announced the “Get Your Knee Off Our Necks” March at Floyd’s funeral in June spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial alongside the families of Black people who have been killed by police in recent memory. “For too long you acted like we didn’t matter” Sharpton told the crowd. “They say ‘Well everybody matters.’ But everybody hasn’t mattered the same in America. The reason we had and we still have to say ‘Black Lives Matter’ is because we get less health care like we don’t matter. We go to jail longer for the same crimes like we don’t matter ... Black lives matter and we won’t stop until it matters to everybody.” Floyd’s sister Bridgett Floyd also addressed march-goers asking them to carry on the legacy her brother created in death. “My brother cannot be a voice today” Floyd said. “We have to be that voice we have to be that change.” The march was planned before 29-year-old Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by police in Kenosha Wisconsin triggering another round of mass protests. Blake’s father Jacob Blake Sr. told the Washington crowd that they were holding court over racism in America pronouncing it “guilty guilty guilty.” Other speakers drove home the need to vote this November. Breonna Taylor’s mother Tamika Palmer thanked those who are working toward justice for her daughter’s death after being shot by Louisville Kentucky police in a no-knock raid. “What we need is change” Palmer said. “And we are at a point where we can get that change but we have to stand together we have to vote.” Organizers took care to prevent spread of Covid-19 mandating that attendees wear masks and doing temperature checks for anyone entering the protest area around the National Mall. But the urgency of the moment attracted such a massive crowd that thousands of protesters filled the area outside the temperature checks and it became harder to socially distance within the protest area itself as the afternoon progressed. Temperatures in the 90s didn’t seem to deter the crowds either with many protesters wading into the reflecting pool to help cool off. The march sought to renew the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.’s iconic “I Have a Dream” speech from 1963 which he gave in front of 250000 demonstrators. That march eventually led to the Civil Rights Act a sweeping set of laws banning discrimination on the basis of race religion sex and national origin across areas of public life like housing employment and public accommodations. Whether the 2020 version achieves substantial legislative change remains to be seen.

Congress’s failure to pass stimulus has had a devastating effect on people of color,headline,https://www.vox.com/21433055/congresss-failure-second-stimulus-devastating-effect-on-minorities-unemployment-covid-bill,www.vox.com,1600223579509
With white unemployment in single digits minority unemployment in double digits and policymakers cutting federal unemployment insurance by triple digits the country finds itself in a situation similar to the one it faced during the Great Recession. Now just as then minorities are bearing the brunt of the recession. Now just as then policymakers are failing to account for that fact — and in doing so are threatening to reinforce the United States’ long-simmering racial inequalities. The national unemployment rate fell to single digits in August at 8.4 percent. However that number conceals America’s racially stratified economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics while white unemployment fell to 7.3 percent in August the Black unemployment rate was at 13.0 percent the Hispanic rate at 10.5 percent and the rate for Asian Americans was 10.7 percent. With unemployment of people of color still incredibly high Congress has yet to approve another round of stimulus funding. And the terms lawmakers are discussing would be less generous than earlier rounds of stimulus. In their “skinny” stimulus bill Republicans suggest setting the federal unemployment insurance benefit — which gave Americans receiving unemployment an extra $600 a week before the program expired in August — to $300. Congressional Democrats have remained adamant that a $600 per week benefit is necessary. Meanwhile some Democratic policy advisers like former Obama economic council chair Jason Furman have pushed Democratic lawmakers to compromise suggesting that an extended unemployment program be reinstated at $400 per week. “The $600 a week boost to weekly unemployment checks may have made sense when the economy has shutdown” Furman wrote on Twitter. “But with an [unemployment rate] of 8.4% it should change. The President’s $400 is reasonable—but the Senate needs to actually pass it for it to be real.” However other experts — pointing to the higher unemployment rate for people of color — disagree. “Jason’s call is tone-deaf” William Spriggs chief economist for the union group AFL-CIO wrote in an email to Vox. Spriggs noted that not only is unemployment high for people of color but that a growing number of job losses are permanent “signaling the labor market is going to be very slow in recovering.” That coupled with the fact families of color have fewer liquid assets than white families “make the $600 necessary” Spriggs said. For many Americans living this reality the combination of absent government stimulus and financial hardship is crushing. Just last week a new NPR poll found “70 percent of Latinos in Los Angeles have experienced serious financial problems because of the job losses and other economic impacts during the pandemic.” To minority communities like these and policymakers concerned about them one thing is clear: Top-line statistics fail to capture all the events happening in a racially stratified economy and policymakers should consider that in their stimulus. The Covid-19 stimulus was generous until it wasn’t In the early days of the coronavirus recession it seemed that American policymakers had learned from their Great Recession mistakes. As researchers for the ACLU and the Social Science Research Council noted in 2015 the last recession and recovery had a racial slant. Their “Impact of the US Housing Crisis on the Racial Wealth Gap Across Generations” report outlined “a tale of two recoveries” noting that “white households have started to rebound from the worst effects of the Great Recession while Black households are still struggling to make up lost ground.” “The divergent recoveries are important in the immediate term but they are also an especially ominous sign for the future” the report’s co-authors Sarah Burd-Sharps and Rebecca Rasch wrote. “Unequal opportunity to rebuild wealth coming out of the crisis is leading to widening racial disparities.” This time around the expanded unemployment benefit appeared to be the type of recessionary policy that economists had long been calling to provide everyday Americans particularly working-class people of color a foothold in the economy. As Vox’s Dylan Matthews notes the $600 a week bump was “a massive expansion in the generosity of the program” and it pushed the wage “replacement rate beyond 100 percent for workers with weekly wages below $600.” But now as the top-line unemployment numbers have come down Congress has failed to come to any consensus on aid for its most vulnerable citizens particularly minorities. And this failure has left these Americans with no aid at all abandoning them to suffer the effects of high unemployment in this unprecedented recession. And despite past warnings about the difficulty people of color have in recovering from recessions lawmakers are repeating the mistakes. America fails to account for the disparate impact of a downturn on communities of color Economists like Michelle Holder an assistant professor of economics at John Jay College argue policymakers failed to address the specific and predictable economic hurdles minorities faced in the last recession and that in not extending unemployment benefits with an extra $600 a week they are threatening to do so again. “The unfortunate thing is that when our policymakers are proposing policies to deal with an economic and cyclical downturn their approach is always a colorblind one even under Obama” Holder says. The Obama administration largely failed to address economic disparities for African Americans and other minority groups during the last recession. Its $787 billion stimulus package was a contributing factor in Black Americans’ prolonged double-digit unemployment during the last downturn Holder notes. Overall providing insufficient stimulus during a time of great financial crisis has become a key criticism of the Obama administration with scholars like Princeton’s Eddie Glaude Jr. going so far as to describe the Great Recession as the “Great Black Depression.” It’s based on these sharp disparities that economists like Holder make their arguments against the reduction of the expanded unemployment insurance program pushed by many Republicans and some Democrats. And it is important lawmakers keep in mind this recent history and the mistakes that need to be avoided in designing future pandemic stimulus. As Holder says “Those calling for the scaling back for the elimination of unemployment insurance are missing the reality which is in this country the burden of the recession is not equally distributed.” Help keep Vox free for all Millions turn to Vox each month to understand what’s happening in the news from the coronavirus crisis to a racial reckoning to what is quite possibly the most consequential presidential election of our lifetimes.

What a second Trump term could mean for LGBTQ people,headline,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/8/26/21374948/trump-second-term-lgbtq-people,www.vox.com,1600223579509
At the Republican National Convention this week Republicans are making the case for giving President Donald Trump four more years in the White House. While Trump himself doesn’t often comment publicly on queer or transgender issues Vice President Mike Pence has a long record of anti-LGBTQ lawmaking and rhetoric and LGBTQ advocates have already called the Republican Party platform — a holdover from 2016 as the GOP did not write one for 2020 — one of the most anti-LGBTQ in the party’s history. Trans people have been a target of the Trump administration from the get-go. Almost immediately after Trump took office in 2017 the administration rolled back an Obama-era memo directing schools to protect trans students from discrimination. That July Trump announced his decision to ban trans people from serving in the military. In May 2018 the administration went after trans prisoners too deciding that in most cases trans people should be housed according to their assigned sex at birth. Just weeks ago the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed a rule that would allow homeless shelters that receive federal funding to house trans people according to their birth-assigned sex. Queer people have also been under attack. Though marriage equality is the law of the land the White House has taken steps to limit or undo gay rights in several key policy areas such as lobbying to give religious adoption agencies the right to refuse same-sex couples. Most critical perhaps was the administration’s attack on the Affordable Care Act’s LGBTQ nondiscrimination protections in a rule released on June 12. Though it has been put on hold due to a federal court stay the rule would allow doctors and insurance companies to refuse care to LGBTQ people. Meanwhile Trump nominated two conservative Supreme Court justices during his presidency but in a surprising turn of events a recent major LGBTQ victory threw the administration for a loop: The Supreme Court decided in June that LGBTQ people are protected on the basis of sex under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The decision in Bostock v. Clayton County means that queer and trans people cannot be fired for being LGBTQ and the ruling could end up as precedent for expanding rights into other issue areas such as education and health care. Still this likely won’t stop conservatives from trying to whittle away and build in carveouts to the legal protections LGBTQ people currently have. It would be similar to the approach taken by religious conservatives with regard to Roe v. Wade — passing anti-abortion legislation at the state level in the hope that related cases work their way back to the Supreme Court. According to activists conservatives will likely try to attack across three different fronts in their efforts to chip away at LGBTQ rights: by continuing to reshape the courts by attacking health care access and by continuing to limit immigration and asylum by LGBTQ people fleeing violence in other countries. The courts are key to queer and trans rights If elected president former Vice President Joe Biden has promised to immediately reverse the military ban and reissue an Obama-era guideline allowing trans students to use the correct bathroom. This would effectively end litigation in the military ban cases and change the complexion of the bathroom cases. However a second Trump term would mean more anti-LGBTQ federal judges appointed possibly a Supreme Court justice or two and an escalation in the legal arguments against trans rights legal advocates say. The bulk of Trump’s anti-LGBTQ actions have come through administrative rules most of which have been challenged in federal court. Because of this Trump’s control over federal policy has been solidified by appointing conservative judges. As of July 194 of the 792 active federal judges were appointed by Trump — that’s a quarter of the federal judiciary — according to Pew Research data. Many of them were either previously anti-LGBTQ activists or who openly express anti-LGBTQ sentiments. Several have already had an impact on pending legal battles. Earlier this year Fifth Circuit judge Kyle Duncan infamously ruled that it is necessary for a court to misgender a trans plaintiff whose case he was overseeing a decision not in line with precedence in other federal courts. And right now there are several ongoing legal cases snaking their way through the federal court system that could end badly for LGBTQ people if put in front of a Trump-appointed judge. These include several lawsuits against the transgender military ban student suits seeking access to school bathrooms according to their gender identity and California v. Texas which is set to decide whether religious entities can legally deny adoption services to gay parents. It will be heard by the court on November 4 just a day after Election Day. These cases could eventually land in front of the Supreme Court which is its own issue. While overturning Bostock or even Obergefell the decision that granted LGBTQ couples marriage equality in 2016 is a tall order unless Trump can appoint two more justices to the high court even one more appointee could set the court up to gut both decisions. “Certainly at least one more Supreme Court appointment would inflict devastating damage on the transgender community that would last for decades to come” Shannon Minter an attorney at the National Center for Lesbian Rights told Vox. “It would be something close to closing the courtroom doors on our foreseeable future.” One way for conservatives to somewhat relitigate and chip away at these landmark decisions is through a change in legal strategy. Throughout its first term the Trump administration argued in court that trans people are not and should not be protected under current sex discrimination laws. This was the basis for several administrative rules rolling back the rights of trans people in health care in homeless shelters and in education. However Bostock turned that argument on its head. According to Chase Strangio an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union the administration has now begun to argue more explicitly that federal sex discrimination law protects cis people from sharing spaces with trans people. It’s a similar tack to the fringe argument that anti-LGBTQ legal groups have long tried — that cis people have a constitutional right not to share locker rooms bathrooms and other gendered spaces with trans people. For example in a statement to the court in a case challenging Connecticut’s school sports transgender inclusion policy earlier this year the administration argued that trans people are not protected under Title IX which protects people on the basis of sex in education. In a more recent post-Bostock filing in a nearly identical case challenging Idaho’s ban on trans girls participating in girl’s school sports the administration took a different angle arguing that Title IX entitles cisgender people protection from sharing spaces and activities with trans people. That policy shift Strangio told Vox would be a scary portent for a second Trump term. Because everything is interconnected the key to making Trump’s strategy work say Minter and Strangio would be more Trump appointees to the already Trump-stacked federal judiciary. The lower court judges would have significant power to shape LGBTQ cases as they move through the federal court system. “My greatest fear is for a judicial action that locates [anti-trans] rights in the Constitution that we couldn’t undo with a new president in the future” said Strangio. “You get some horrible constitutional ruling that then authorizes discrimination in a host of contexts because trans people are so abhorrent that you have a constitutional right not to share space with them.” Health care is likely the next big fight for LGBTQ people Even before the pandemic health care was going to loom large over this election cycle. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act during Trump’s term. The administration even submitted a brief to the Supreme Court recently arguing that the law should be completely thrown out. The ACA was a landmark piece of health care legislation for Americans — particularly so for LGBTQ people. Under an HHS rule established by the Obama administration in 2016 the bill banned health care discrimination against LGBTQ people but just as key for queer communities were protections for coverage of preexisting conditions. Before the law was passed anyone diagnosed with gender dysphoria or HIV/AIDS could legally be excluded from health insurance coverage and transition care could be legally excluded from any insurance plans. “I can’t think of a more important issue for transgender people than access to health care because if we’re not able to access transition-related care it’s just impossible to have a meaningful authentic life” said Minter. Should the administration succeed at the Supreme Court in California v. Texas slated to be heard this fall people could again be subject to wholesale exclusion from insurance coverage. But even if the law is preserved in some form the administration has already worked to limit LGBTQ access to health care. In mid-June just days before the Bostock decision came down the administration finalized a rule clarifying that LGBTQ people are not entitled to sex-based protections under the ACA effectively rolling back the Obama-era rule saying the opposite. The rule as written would allow insurance companies to once again have blanket exclusions on coverage of transition-related procedures and they could once again deny coverage of health care that doesn’t comport to a person’s legal gender meaning a trans man could be denied coverage for gynecological care. The rule would also have had a significant impact on lesbian gay and bisexual cisgender people in the US by allowing doctors health care providers and insurance companies to deny care or coverage to cis queer people. “We know LGBTQ people face discrimination in health care” David Stacy who leads the federal policy team at the Human Rights Campaign told Vox. “It can be overt discrimination but it can also be more subtle discrimination.” Last Monday however a federal judge issued a stay on the rule’s implementation while the case is litigated saying that the rule likely violates Bostock and that HHS failed to reconsider this after the Supreme Court’s decision. But despite the stay there are still potential avenues a second-term Trump administration could take to attack trans health care access in particular. Minter suggested that depending on the makeup of Congress the administration could take steps to ban transition-related care from Medicaid coverage try to reinstate a Medicare exclusion that existed prior to 2016 or even try to institute a Food and Drug Administration ban on puberty blockers for trans adolescents. The administration could also use executive action to end transition care offered through Veteran’s Affairs. “They’ll try to cut off access to health care for trans people any way they can” said Minter. “They can do a lot of damage on the health care front. It would be in my opinion probably the single most devastating impact on the trans community.” Immigration rights are a life-and-death issue for LGBTQ people LGBTQ issues like health care and the military ban frequently take center stage when discussing the administration’s record but perhaps nothing is as life and death for queer and trans people as immigration and asylum policies. In late 2018 31-year-old trans woman Camila Díaz Córdova fled her native El Salvador fearing for her life. She reportedly made her way to the US with a migrant caravan and attempted to apply for asylum only to be denied and deported back to her home country. In late January 2019 she was murdered by three police officers. It’s a problem that will only worsen in a Trump second term. “The rules of asylum are completely changing” Bamby Salcedo founder of the Trans Latina Coalition told Vox. “Through that process a lot of people are being excluded. This is something that will definitely impact trans women.” Over the last three-and-a-half years the Trump administration has made it increasingly difficult for those fleeing gender-based violence to obtain asylum in the United States. In November 2018 Trump tightened immigration rules which restricted asylum to anyone who first passed through Mexico to arrive at the US southern border. And this June the Department of Homeland Security proposed a new rule which would allow immigration officials to dismiss asylum seekers’ applications as “frivolous” without a hearing. As explained by Vox’s Nicole Narea the proposed rule is part of a larger election-year push against immigration in general. Using the pandemic as an excuse Trump has closed the border with Mexico started quickly deporting asylum seekers who show up at the southern border and issued a temporary ban on issuing new green cards. All of these restrictions come at a real cost for trans people especially trans women in Central America. There is an epidemic of violence against trans women of color throughout the Americas but it is acutely felt in Central America. According to a report by Trans Murder Monitoring at least 258 trans or gender-diverse people were murdered in Latin America between October 2018 and September 2019. “The new asylum regulations that Trump has already proposed if they were finalized it will be devastating for LGBT asylum seekers. And they’ll effectively just shut the door to asylum” said Minter. The public comment period ended on July 15 and the rule could be finalized before Election Day. However should Democrats retake the Senate and White House they’ll be able to override any administration rules issued within 60 legislative days of the new Congress taking office via the Congressional Review Act. Salcedo said that the possibility that Biden could win the presidency gives her hope — not just for the immigration and asylum system but that other trans-related policies could improve in short order. “I am hopeful that you know the new administration will revert all of those policies that have attempted to come into effect” she said. “I’m hopeful that there’s tangible and institutional changes that are going to happen. And I firmly believe that that could become a reality.” New goal: 25000 In the spring we launched a program asking readers for financial contributions to help keep Vox free for everyone and last week we set a goal of reaching 20000 contributors.

"I did Shop With a Cop as a kid. Now I realize it was police propaganda.",headline,https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/9/10/21427923/police-black-lives-matter-shop-with-a-cop,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Editor’s note: This piece includes descriptions of gun violence. It’s September and Jacob Blake was almost murdered. He was shot seven times by a Kenosha Wisconsin cop who tried to detain him. Last month I could have replaced that name with a different Black person’s. I could have done the same the month before. I scroll through my Twitter timeline and see outrage but I also see viral videos of cops dancing with protesters or kneeling or hugging them just moments before knocking an eye out of its socket. The video I see most is of National Guard officers in combat gear doing the Macarena in Atlanta. My followers mostly retweet to critique but underneath those retweets I see replies saying that these moments are special heartwarming. That these images of cops and protesters holding up their fists side by side are what America needs right now. Moments like these — where I witness both revolution and the gross but subtle attempts to keep it from looking like one — remind me of my first experience with the police where I unwittingly participated in pro-police propaganda. As I’ve grown and my understanding of my place as a Black woman in this world has sharpened I look back at this experience with an uncomfortable recognition of how my Blackness was being used. If I told you I remembered exactly when I stopped trusting the police I’d be lying. I’m sure the distrust trickled down to me the way secrets and traditions do. I’m sure like every young Black person does I just observed or overheard it and realized eventually people were right. Maybe my childhood low-income apartment complex taught me. We were a neighborhood full of parents siblings everyone Black. We were a neighborhood that came alive in the summer. We left our bikes in the yard or in the middle of the street or on our neighbor’s porch so he could fix it. We chased down the ice cream truck chased down coins to buy something sold lemonade made no money tried again the next day. With all that commotion police would of course drive through the neighborhood frequently. They’d inch down each side of the complex as if they were observing every single one of us every centimeter of our skin. Some of us would stay where we were unbothered waiting for a challenge. But most of my neighbors because they knew danger would come scattered. When I was about 11 or 12 years old I was selected to participate in Indianapolis’s annual Shop With a Cop program hosted by the Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #86. I wasn’t old enough to know that Black people often got killed by police. But I was old enough to recognize that in my neighborhood when you saw cops you abandoned the outdoors and went back inside. I was also old enough to keep some things to myself — to know not to tell my friends or others in the neighborhood that I’d be on an all-day excursion with a cop. Shop With a Cop brings together Marion County police officers from 11 departments to take “needy children from all over the Indianapolis community” shopping for the winter holidays. It’s a day-long event complete with a movie showing meals and a trip to Walmart or Meijer to shop for more expensive winter needs — or whatever you may point at and ask for. The PR pitch from a police perspective is that it’s a time to give back and to give low-income children a positive police experience. Last December the Indianapolis program assisted about 350 families; it boasts the largest Shop With a Cop program in the country with many other cities having a similar program. Though the holidays were always hard for us that winter seemed different. My mom had applied for Christmas help all over the city and after completing the paperwork and meeting income guidelines I was chosen. The same winter I participated a family also sponsored me through another non-police-related Christmas program — getting as much as they could off my mom’s wish list which included a few toys and some clothes since the police department was covering the winter coat and other necessities. What I remembered about my Shop With a Cop experience was that I went with a white male cop to Walmart and the movie theater afterward. What my mom told me when I checked more than 15 years later was that I went with a Black woman cop. My mom said she probably wouldn’t have let me go had it been a white male cop but the Black woman made her feel comfortable. The cop pulled up according to my mom and came into the apartment to chat with both her and my grandmother. I remember being quiet just waiting to get the day over with. What I didn’t tell my mom revisiting this conversation as an adult was that the police department sending someone who looked like us was by design. I didn’t tell her that all those years later learning it was a Black cop instead of a white cop didn’t soothe me. I had learned too much about my Blackness and our history and had protested for too many Black people who had been wrongfully killed by police to be comforted. I didn’t mention that the sole purpose of sending a Black cop to our Black neighborhood was to ease us into comfort. That it was all for aesthetics — if we see a seemingly nice Black cop we believe even if we’ve experienced differently that there is some good in a system that was created with the intent to harm us. I decided not to bring it back up to my mom because I’m sure she already knows all of this even if she doesn’t have the words for it. Early teens the beginning of high school maybe. My best friends and I attended the Indiana Black Expo Summer Celebration — an annual almost two-week event of exhibits performances and activities — in downtown Indianapolis that we saved our small allowances over for months. We didn’t have money for the actual events planned by the organization only enough to give our parents gas money buy some food while we walked around and possibly buy an item from one of the exhibits in the convention center. It was a Saturday evening. The sun set the downtown sidewalks got more packed and we stood in front of a Steak ’n Shake trying to decide what to do next. The officers rode on horses galloping down the road towering over every Black kid in Indianapolis who could find a ride or was old enough to catch public transit. I guess we stood for too long. I guess the officer who approached us didn’t like my friend’s tone. I guess he thought she was old enough Black enough to slam into the restaurant’s wall her cheek bunching up and mouth still open. I guess he thought one less of us was better. He packed her into a paddy wagon along with plenty of other Black teens. I don’t know if we yelled or told the officer to stop. What I know is we were powerless. What I know is my first personal experience with the police was shopping and that was physically harmless. What I know is when you’re Black you never know when it’ll be your time at what age they’ll stop performing kindness and start performing hate. After the introductions at my apartment the cop and I got into the car to start our shopping excursion. As we drove she turned on the sirens like she was supposed to. What might have been exciting for other children wasn’t exciting for me but triggering to the sounds I often heard in my neighborhood and the fear that arose when they did. I sank down in my seat until we got to the store. Throughout the experience I don’t remember saying much. I remember being excited that I could get a coat. I remember not loving the movie we saw. But what I remember vividly is the nagging feeling I had the urge to keep looking around the store and the mostly empty dark theater to see if anyone was watching me. If any white people assumed I was some no-good Black kid since I was sitting with a cop and many Black kids my age had already had run-ins with the justice system. If any Black people around me worried that I was in danger for the same reason. That whole day I couldn’t shake the feeling that everything — getting into the police car in my neighborhood being seen at the Walmart — could expose me to ridicule from my neighbors and friends. I was maybe too young to fully understand why they would tease me but my neighbors knew something I didn’t: The police may act like they want to support low-income Black communities but everything I was participating in was for show. The experience was supposed to be a positive one but in the end nothing about Shop With a Cop made me any less wary of police. Even back then I understood it was transactional: I was there for the items I needed but couldn’t afford. I knew deep down that cops had opinions about me or my neighborhood or my family even if I couldn’t articulate it. As far as I know I never saw the Black woman cop again. White officers were the only ones I saw in the neighborhood from then on. When the protests in response to George Floyd’s murder began my Twitter timeline was full of Black people tweeting about their first negative encounter with cops. They were 11 years old or 13 14 16. Older if they were lucky. But most of them weren’t lucky. Most of them had already been slammed onto the sidewalk by police officers at a young age for being for existing. Most of them figured out quickly what streets to avoid what neighborhoods didn’t want them around what stores they’d get followed in. Sometimes if we time it right we can avoid the cops. We can live and they’ll let us. Unless we jut outside of invisible lines boundaries unknown to anyone but them. From the time I went to Black Expo as a teen to the times I ignored that we had officers in our public schools but the other schools didn’t the time I participated in a die-in at Indiana University the time Michael Brown was murdered and I protested and Alton Sterling was murdered and I protested and George Floyd Ahmaud Arbery Breonna Taylor Dreasjon Reed and Tony McDade were murdered and I protested I was forced to learn that Black people weren’t the target audience for protecting and serving. Programs like Shop With a Cop are masterful propaganda. Just like the “good cop” images floating around the internet and on the news they serve to make cops look good. Officers can point at these programs when challenged about what they’re doing for low-income Black communities or when they kill a Black person. For some Black people I imagine these programs keep them conflicted about whether or not all cops are “bad” even though a system designed to destroy us can be nothing but. And I guess that’s the point. But for me the few programs offered to “needy children” via the Indianapolis police weren’t enough to prepare me or make me accept the state violence inflicted on Black people. When you have no choice but to accept assistance from institutions and systems that will inflict harm on you and people who look like you you realize how much state violence resembles an abusive partner. They perform affection and support then harm you. Then do it again and harm you just to make sure you need them enough.

Meet the students thriving in remote learning,headline,https://www.vox.com/first-person/21433095/coroanavirus-covid-19-school-reopening-online-learning-remote,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Among teachers and students there’s a widespread understanding that online courses are a poor substitute for the quintessential education experience. They remove the social aspect of schooling and make the collaboration and group-work aspects of scholarship nearly impossible. Broadly those concerns have merit; in 2018 the New York Times reported that on average students in digital classes tended to perform worse than those who studied directly with a teacher. But since the country entered its unprecedented distance learning experiment this spring there’s been a growing contingent of students who’ve found themselves actually enjoying their cyberspace syllabus more than the physical version. “I’m an introvert who deals with a lot of social anxiety” said Maude a 20-year-old special care counseling student in Quebec who has been taking remote classes since March and into the new school year. “In an online classroom I don’t have to be around people or feel apprehensive about asking the teacher questions. Instead I’m as calm as I can be in my safe space at home.” While teachers parents and experts have voiced concerns over how digital school will impact students’ development many have pointed out that some students are thriving in the new environment. “I can’t say enough about how this closure has changed my entire approach to teaching because I see how it has been an amazing respite for so many students” said Rosie Reid California’s 2019 Teacher of the Year in an interview with Edutopia. There’s no one reason why remote learning — which ranges from more hands-on instruction to hands-off assignments depending on the school — fits better for some students more than others. Some enjoy how loose and untethered an online education is. Others have struggled for years with the social anxiety inherent in a classroom and are finally at peace doing schoolwork in the safety of their bedroom. Nobody fears being late for class anymore. One student told me this extended break from campus has revealed that many of his general education responsibilities aren’t substantial and that maybe they’d be better off with classes two or three times a week. I spoke to four students who expressed the surprising joys of digital schooling. These students at least are not necessarily thrilled about going back to in-person classes when the pandemic finally allows them to do so. “I have ADHD and I’ve been able to focus on my schoolwork so much better now” Jacob 14 Minnesota Like many students around the country I first heard my school would be closing down in March after they extended our spring break for two weeks. That was back in my spring semester when I was in middle school and the administration restarted the year by sending over material on Schoology [virtual classroom software]. We just did our work at home. For this year which is my first year of high school I’ve had a lot more meetings over Zoom alongside the Schoology work. I have to check in every day things like that. Last year all I had to do was fill out an attendance sheet of what we did on a school day and send it into the teacher. It’s a lot more robust now. These days I can expect to talk to my teachers every day. I didn’t expect to enjoy online classes as much as I have. At first I was pretty frustrated. It felt like a raw deal to have to do schoolwork while also not being able to see my friends every day. The best part by far is that I typically finish all of my work by around 10 in the morning rather than 3 in the afternoon. Like I’ll wake up at 7:30 and be done with school before the morning is over. When it started both my parents and I were wondering if we were screwing up. Like “Are we missing something here?” But no that’s just kinda how it works when you’re out of a classroom. I have ADHD and I’ve been able to focus on my schoolwork so much better now that there’s not a constant commotion around me. That’s one of the reasons I think I’ve been able to get the work done so much faster. I don’t have to worry about people talking or other background noise. One of the things that has always bothered me is the buzzing from the fluorescent lights. That’s been eliminated entirely. I’ve also noticed that my grades have improved since pivoting to distance learning though I’m not sure if that’s because they’ve been giving us less work or that I’ve just been able to concentrate better. My friends and I have been talking about some of the efficiency issues in school. Even before the pandemic I tended to get my work done fairly quickly so Covid has only made me question the schedule more. It’s bittersweet for my friends and I; we finish school early but we still don’t get to hang out with each other. If we could do both that’d be ideal. “In physical classes I spent so much of my energy trying to calm down” Maude 20 Quebec In March all of our classes went online and by the summer it became clear that I was going to be headed to school digitally for the foreseeable future. I didn’t have many details beyond that. We just kind of stood pat until July when all the details were confirmed. I’m 20 years old and study special care counseling in Quebec and for now I’m doing all my classwork and studies from home. I understand that there are students out there who probably have a difficult time focusing on their academics from their bedroom. But if I’m being honest I was thrilled when I heard we’d be pivoting to a purely digital environment. I’m an introvert who deals with a lot of social anxiety but in an online classroom I don’t have to be around people or feel apprehensive about speaking up. I struggle to raise my hand in class and usually I end up waiting until the end of a session to get my three to four questions I had. Now I can just ask whenever I want in online chat. I’m as calm as I can be in my safe space at home. These days I wake up around 8 am and plan a to-do list. After that I jump right into my homework and take a short break for a couple of minutes every hour and a half. We’re sent PowerPoint presentations and short videos to simulate all the lessons. I don’t have to worry about getting to all of my classes on time and because of that I’m much more efficient. I’ve become proactive in my studies. I don’t procrastinate nearly as much and as a whole I find myself far more on top of things from a logistical perspective. In physical classes I spent so much of my energy trying to calm down. There are some downsides though. This was my last semester of classes for my program so it’s sad to not be around my incredible teachers from that program. School is supposed to be spent surrounded by people passionate about the same things you are so you can all develop your skills together. We won’t be able to enjoy that in the way we should. Also this semester has actually cost me more money than my previous ones. My tuition goes to the libraries and cafes on campus that we can’t use right now. That doesn’t seem particularly fair. But overall I really hope colleges evaluate some of the advantages of online classes in the future. I’m going to miss them when they’re gone. They’re not perfect for every curriculum but personally I’ve found them to be very useful. “The classroom feels outdated” Gideon 17 Florida I was at the tail end of spring break and my district extended that break for a week once Covid hit. Things kind of progressed from there and we moved to a fully online system that semester. It was a mix of emotions for me. I’m in a position of privilege. I have access to the resources to get online and all that stuff. There are people in my community who are doing a lot worse than me and school is an escape for them. It’s a weird dynamic. But despite that I’ve really enjoyed doing school virtually. My high school is divided into a bunch of different academies and I study Photoshop and Premiere Pro. So most of the time I don’t have live meetings. I just needed to register my attendance and then I can do whatever I want. The idea is that I’ll spend those hours working on my various different portfolios but effectively they’re allowing us total free time. I’ve never been the type to cut class but it’s crazy that we’ve been afforded that opportunity. It feels like I’m still on summer break. I barely have any academic meetings now. I guess in a weird way this pandemic intersected with the perfect time in my academic career. As a senior I’ve knocked out most of my general studies so all I’ve got left are the digital art ventures I would be doing anyway. It feels like after Covid high schools around the country are going to revert right back into the five-days-a-week model. That seems shortsighted to me. All of this has really made me reconsider if in-person classes are that useful for students like me. Even before Covid I did the vast majority of my creative work at home. I think I focus best when I’m in my room and within my specialized curriculum I’ve come to believe that there’s a huge amount of filler in the education system. I homed in on Photoshop and Premiere Pro since I was a freshman and most of my other general education courses seemed unnecessary. Why am I taking an AP biology class when I could be taking more communications classes? It doesn’t make much sense to me. The classroom feels outdated. The only people using the quadratic formula are high school students and high school teachers. It doesn’t bleed over into real life. “The constant stress of where I’m supposed to be and when I’m supposed to be there is all gone now” Nick 26 North Carolina I’ve been doing online classes at Duke for about half a semester cumulatively. At the beginning I was pretty bummed out about it. Obviously I didn’t want to go to in-person classes during a pandemic. I’m immunocompromised so I was concerned about my safety. But also graduate school is a lot of money. It’s probably overpriced to begin with and that value has certainly changed without the in-person community. There was nothing I could do about that. Duke is a huge institution and I’m just me. But surprisingly the longer I’ve done these online classes the more I’ve valued them. I work 25 hours a week in public policy so my schedule was already pretty squeezed. It was really difficult to go from class to my job then back to class in a single day. It was a balancing act for me and so many other grad students. All of that bedlam the constant stress of where I’m supposed to be and when I’m supposed to be there is all gone now. There’s more opportunity when I’m between classes to just chill out and be a human without worrying about my next pit stop. It’s funny this pandemic has been an extremely stressful time for everyone. But at the same time at least I don’t need to worry about being late for lecture. It’s the little things right? I think if I’m being honest with myself I’m going to miss these online classes when they’re gone. I’m not going to miss our current moment obviously or miss grappling with the real value of my current experience. But I will miss the way I was able to spend my time and how I feel right now. It’s the best it can be right now and I’m enjoying it more than I thought I would.

Do the Oscars’ new rules mean no more movies about white people?,headline,https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/9/9/21429083/oscars-best-picture-rules-diversity-inclusion,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The Oscars are rounding the corner toward its 100th birthday — next year’s ceremony whatever form it takes will be the 93rd — but the awards show is far from set in its ways. Just in the last year the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences the professional organization that gives out the Oscars has shifted the rules to rename a category and accommodate a pandemic. Not long ago the organization was toying with a new “Best Popular Picture” category although whether it will ever actually be awarded is unclear. And a few short years ago the membership guidelines changed in order to deal with its diversity problems. And now the guidelines are changing again. The Academy has announced changes to the Best Picture category aimed at the lofty goal of making Hollywood more diverse. But it’s caused some confusion with people (some of whom don’t seem to have actually read the guidelines before weighing in) alternately cheering and booing the changes. So here’s a quick guide to the guidelines what they actually mean for the Oscars and whether they’ll have any effect on either the show or the industry at large. What are these new Oscar rules? On September 8 the Academy announced a set of new eligibility guidelines for films aiming to compete for Best Picture considered the top prize at the Oscars. There are four categories of inclusion standards. You can read the full standards on the Oscars website but they basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment. Movies will need to meet the standards in two of four categories in order to qualify. First a note. This gets wordy fast so to make it easier I’ll use the following terminology: The Academy designates “underrepresented racial or ethnic groups” within the standards to include Asian Hispanic/Latinx Black/African American Indigenous/Native American/Alaskan Native Middle Eastern/North African Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander or “other underrepresented race or ethnicity.” I’ll refer to this category as underrepresented racial or ethnic groups. The Academy also designates a broader set of identity groups within the standards which includes the underrepresented racial and ethnic groups listed above as well as women LBGTQ+ people and people with cognitive or physical disabilities or who are deaf or hard of hearing. For simplicity’s sake I’ll refer to this group taken together as underrepresented identity groups. The first category of standards (which the Academy calls Group A) deals with the stories or characters on the actual screen. In this category movies must have one of the following: At least one “lead or significant supporting actor” from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group. Or ... At least 30 percent of a cast in secondary and minor roles from two underrepresented identity groups. Or ... A main storyline or subject that centers on an underrepresented identity group. Group B standards regard the creative and production team behind the film. To meet these standards a film must meet one of the following criteria: At least two heads of major departments (such as editing director makeup and hairstyling costuming or sound as well as many others) must be from an underrepresented identity group. Additionally a minimum of one of these must be from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group. Or ... At least six people on the crew (excluding production assistants generally the entry-level position on set) are from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group. Or ... At least 30 percent of the crew are from an underrepresented identity group. Group C standards have to do with the (paid) training opportunities that film companies offer groups of people who are underrepresented in Hollywood. There’s some fine print here distinguishing between huge companies with deep pockets (like Disney and Warner Bros.) and smaller companies or independent productions. But in general to qualify in this category the film’s production company or distributor must meet both of these two standards: Must offer paid internship or apprenticeship opportunities in a variety of departments to people from underrepresented identity groups and must actually be employing people in those positions (numbers vary according to the size of the company). And ... Must offer training and work opportunities in “below the line” (essentially lower- and mid-level positions) to people from underrepresented identity groups. Group D standards deal with “audience development” with is Hollywood’s way of talking about the parts of the business that get people to buy tickets to movies. To qualify in this category the studio or company distributing the film must have “multiple” senior-level executives from underrepresented identity groups on their marketing publicity or distribution teams. Remember: Films will only need to meet the standards in a minimum of two of these four groups in order to be eligible to compete for Best Picture. Additionally these rules don’t kick in until the 2024 Oscars (which because of the way awards calendars work covers movies released in 2023) which means that they won’t apply to movies that come out in 2021 or 2022. However beginning with films released in 2021 filmmakers will need to submit a confidential form that indicates how closely their films align with those standards in order to be eligible; presumably they will still be eligible if they don’t comply but the data will help both the companies and the Academy see where there are still gaps in the industry’s inclusion efforts. It’s important to note that this is only for the Best Picture category — so a film could not meet these standards and still be eligible for other awards. Why is the Academy changing the rules? Great question! In short though Hollywood is inching toward more diversity problems persist. The first is that for a variety of reasons Hollywood — that is the American film industry — is still predominately a place where white men and to a lesser extent white women from well-off backgrounds fill the key decision-making positions at major studios as well as “mini-major” and independent production companies. White men still also direct most of the movies write most of the movies and produce most of the movies especially the ones with big budgets. (They’re also still most of the film critics but critics don’t work for Hollywood so that’s on media companies.) That has for a long time had a visible effect on which stories get told who gets money to tell them who gets to fail and continue working and — most pertinently for the Academy — which movies get rewarded at the Oscars. The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at USC has done a great job documenting and studying the lack of diversity in Hollywood if you’d like to read more. Because membership in the Academy is based on factors like years spent working in Hollywood awards won and name recognition and because membership in the Academy is for life the makeup of the voting body has long been heavily slanted toward older white men. A Los Angeles Times investigation in 2012 found that the median Oscar voter was a white man around age 65. The membership was 94 percent white and 77 percent male; only 2 percent of the Academy was Black and less than 2 percent identified as Latinx. The LA Times also found that only 14 percent of the membership was younger than age 50. Following the LA Times investigation and later the #OscarsSoWhite embarrassment the Academy began making strides toward expanding its membership making it more representative of the American moviegoing public at large. That meant inviting more racially and ethnically diverse people to join and larger numbers of younger people. Today after years of inviting record numbers of new members the Academy has increased its diversity. Between 2015 and 2020 the percentage of female members increased from 25 percent to 33 percent. The percentage of people from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups has grown from 10 percent to 19 percent. (Full statistics are available through the Oscars website.) At a glance that doesn’t look like a huge increase but since people who have been members for decades remain in the organization even as new members are added that percentage will take years to shift. The percentage of Academy members is not directly tied to or predictive of Best Picture nominees nor nominees in any other category. But the group is recognizing a fuller range of experiences one that more closely matches the actual moviegoing audience in its voting body. And so the Academy is aiming to expand the pool of possibility away from what has in the past been traditionally considered an “Oscar movie” and what has been considered “niche.” The new eligibility guidelines are another move toward that goal. Does this mean a movie like The Irishman wouldn’t be eligible for Best Picture in future years? The Irishman fits the bill just fine. Yes it’s a movie directed by a white man mostly starring white men. But many of Scorsese’s longtime collaborators are (mostly white) women including producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff; casting director Ellen Lewis; and editor Thelma Schoonmaker who has been working with Scorsese from the very beginning. The film’s cinematographer Rodrigo Preto is from Mexico. Those staffing decisions fulfill the requirements of Category B. The film was funded and distributed by Netflix a company that includes many women and many people of color among its executive team including in key communications and publicity positions and promotes internal development programs focused on diversity and inclusion — all factors in fulfilling Categories C and D. And that doesn’t take into account any LGBTQ+ people or people with disabilities — factors that aren’t obvious if you’re just perusing IMDb or may not be publicly known — who might be involved. What about Little Women? Little Women being about well women easily meets the criteria for Category A even though its main cast is entirely white. It’s also directed by a woman produced by a team of women and largely employed women as department heads. And though you certainly can’t tell if a person fits into one of the broader Academy-designated underrepresented groups purely on name and picture a quick scan of the IMDb page makes it pretty clear that at least 30 percent of the crew fits the requirements of Category B. (That doesn’t even take into account Categories C and D at Sony Pictures Entertainment the film’s distributor which recently launched a diversity and inclusion initiative nor the categories of LGBTQ+ people and people with disabilities.) What about Green Book? The 2019 Best Picture winner took a lot of (in my view deserved) flak for its regressive and whitewashed view of race in America. But it also easily passes the test. Mahershala Ali won his second Oscar for his role in the film which certainly qualifies as a “significant supporting actor” (and thereby fulfills Category A). Among its executive producers are Octavia Spencer and Kwame L. Parker (which fulfills Category B). It was distributed by Universal Pictures which is led by chairwoman Donna Langley; Universal’s head of distribution is Veronika Kwan Vandenberg and its head of global communications is Cindy Gardner (Category D). And Universal has an established global talent development and inclusion program (Category C). These three examples are all films from big studios with money to throw around of course. But a film like say Moonlight — the lowest-budget film to ever win a Best Picture Oscar at $1.5 million — would have qualified easily given that most of its cast are Black its director Barry Jenkins is Black Jenkins’ co-writer Tarell Alvin McCraney is Black (and gay) a number of heads of key departments are Black and the movie’s main storyline focuses on a Black gay character. Is this just empty signaling then? Or will the new guidelines have an effect on Hollywood? It’s hard to say right now of course. In fact it feels like films will have to work hard not to be able to tick off two of four boxes. But that might be the point. Submitting a film for Best Picture consideration will require the submission of a confidential form for two years before the guidelines go into effect. That means film companies aiming for awards will have a chance to see if they are lacking in a key area and correct that blind spot before 2024. The easiest way to ensure that a company’s films will be eligible for Best Picture is to do two things: establish ongoing paid internships apprenticeships and career opportunities for people from underrepresented groups; and ensure that people from underrepresented groups are in key audience development positions in the company. Then even the whitest straightest most cisgendered-male movie about people with no disabilities created and directed and produced by the same would still qualify provided the company itself was promoting inclusion and diversity. That’s an option more accessible to large film studios because they have the resources to pour into developing talent. And yet a significant number of low- and mid-budget movies which may be produced by companies without those resources generate good buzz at film festivals and are then bought by larger companies. Then they’ll be able to take advantage of their distributors’ investment in diversity and inclusion initiatives. Of course a company could elect not to focus on those kinds of initiatives either because they don’t have the resources or for some other reason. But if they produce or distribute a film that is about an underrepresented ethnic or racial group women LGBTQ+ people or people with disabilities and if people from those groups are also in key artistic positions or comprise at least 30 percent of the crew then the film will still qualify for Best Picture consideration. Overall though it seems clear that the Academy’s new eligibility guidelines are designed mostly to encourage different hiring and development practices even more than promoting greater diversity in the stories that audiences see on screen. Are there potential issues with this? Absolutely. You can imagine a film company in which tokenism is promoted with apprenticeship and internship programs that lead nowhere the minimum number of people from underrepresented groups promoted into key positions and a lot of lip service paid to diversity and inclusion with very few results. You can also easily imagine — because it happens all the time right now — a world in which movies about people of color are made by largely white creative teams (like for instance Disney’s recent live-action remake of Mulan) yet qualify because of the production company’s diversity initiatives. Similarly the guidelines make a lot of equivalences that seem at best problematic. Is being gay the “same” as being Black? Is being trans the “same” as being deaf? Is being a woman the “same” as being of Asian descent? Some of the underrepresented categories are more consistently discriminated against than others explicitly or implicitly and guidelines such as these could simply lead to even more rigid unspoken hierarchies in hiring — a proposition that’s a bit horrifying to consider. The Academy has given themselves a few years to see whether this produces an effect and perhaps iron out some of the wrinkles so it’s possible we may see tweaks and changes to the guidelines in the future. As of right now though it’s somewhat hard to think of recent Best Picture nominees that wouldn’t qualify under these rules or wouldn’t easily qualify with a few company- or crew-level tweaks. It seems like this won’t fix the #OscarsSoWhite problem though Correct! These rules only apply to films submitted for Best Picture consideration. And given that a movie with an all-white cast or story focused primarily on men is still eligible it doesn’t even guarantee that the Best Picture nominees will focus on significantly more diverse stories than they have in the past. That said movies are usually trying to qualify in a number of different categories and most films that are aiming for the Oscars at least secretly dream of getting a Best Picture slot. So the rules could have some trickle-down effect on casting choices and on which films get the “buzz” that can help propel individual performers directors writers and others into the individual categories. But that’s far from a given. That’s always the issue with trying to generate massive industry-wide systemic change especially in an industry like Hollywood which pays a lot of lip service to inclusivity but is fundamentally conservative and averse to whatever the people at the top perceive as risks — whether that risk is the perception that “Black films don’t travel” or that “men won’t go see a film about women.” So are the Oscars going to look significantly different in 2024 than they have for the past decade? It’s impossible to know but there’s no guarantee that they will. Yet if the goal of these eligibility guidelines is to incentivize investing in a more diverse inclusive workforce it may have some impact — even in a limited way.

The Black lives that don’t make headlines still matter,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/9/5/21423349/the-black-lives-that-dont-make-headlines-still-matter-dijon-kizzee-breonna-taylor,www.vox.com,1600223579509
On August 31 Dijon Kizzee a Black man was shot and killed as he fled from police in Los Angeles California. On September 2 new video emerged of Daniel Prude a Black man being suffocated with a “spit hood” by police in Rochester New York earlier this spring. On August 18 Adrian Jason Roberts a mentally ill Black Army veteran was killed by police serving Roberts an involuntary commitment order in Cumberland County North Carolina. Since March 13 and the tragic killing of Breonna Taylor in her home in Louisville Kentucky the police have killed 83 Black people according to the Washington Post. Other organizations put the total even higher: The Mapping Police Violence database notes more than 100 Black people killed by police since March 13. More than likely these deaths will usher in no legal reckoning. According to the Mapping Police Violence database “99 percent of killings by police from 2013-2019 have not resulted in officers being charged with a crime.” It is this slow steady drip of police killings that ultimately drives Black families activists and their allies to protest in the streets. “So many people have reached out to me telling me they’re sorry that this happened to my family” Letetra Wideman Jacob Blake’s sister said during a press conference last week. “Well don’t be sorry. Because this has been happening to my family for a long time. Longer than I can account for. It happened to Emmett Till. Emmett Till is my family. Philando Mike Brown. Sandra. This has been happening to my family. And I’ve shed tears for every single one of these people that it’s happened to. This is nothing new. I’m not sad. I’m not sorry. I’m angry. And I’m tired.” Independent of the news cycle Black people are disproportionately killed by the police According to the Washington Post which won a Pulitzer for creating the first nationwide tracker of police killings “the rate at which Black Americans are killed by police is more than twice as high as the rate for white Americans.” Yes more white Americans are killed by police in total each year but Black Americans who make up less than 13 percent of the US population represent 24 percent of those shot and killed by police according to the Post’s database. Additionally the Post notes that the number of people the police kill annually holds steady. “Police nationwide have shot and killed almost the same number of people annually — nearly 1000 — since The Post began its project” the Fatal Force project reads. “Probability theory may offer an explanation. It holds that the quantity of rare events in huge populations tends to remain stable absent major societal changes such as a fundamental shift in police culture or extreme restrictions on gun ownership.” In other words the high probability of steady and disproportionate Black death is why racial justice activists have to take to the streets to fight for major societal changes: to break the cycle. For example the Movement for Black Lives-sponsored legislation like the Breathe Act aims to solve problems like excessive policing and insufficient social welfare programs in Black communities. And in addition to issues like the ubiquity of guns and violent police culture scholars also note racialized poverty as a driver of disparities in police killings. Inequality exacerbates racialized police killings but doesn’t explain the gap entirely According to a 2020 analysis by the People’s Policy Project based on census poverty data and the Fatal Encounters police killing database across all races the higher the poverty rate of the neighborhood the higher the police killing rate in the community. NYU School of Medicine’s Justin Feldman lead researcher on the project found that “rates of police killings increase in tandem with census tract poverty for the overall population and within the white Black and Latino populations.” “For the overall population the rate of police killings increased as census tract poverty increased” Feldman’s report found. For the poorest Americans there were 6.4 police killings per million compared with 1.8 per million for the richest Americans. That means you are three times more likely to be killed by police if you are poor than if you are rich. This trend is particularly disturbing once you account for the racial stratification of American poverty. While a plurality of white Americans live in the country’s least-poor neighborhoods a plurality of Black Americans live in the country’s poorest neighborhoods exposing them to a heightened threat of police fatalities. Black people in poor neighborhoods had the highest rate of killings by police of any demographic measured in the report. At 12.3 per million it is nearly double the national rate for police killings in the highest poverty neighborhoods. Yet even after accounting for racial economic stratification the study estimates that Black Americans’ disproportionate poverty only accounts for about 30 percent of the disparity in police deaths with researchers suggesting that race-based discrimination likely fuels much of the gap. In total the combination of omnipresent guns the racial nature of American poverty the violent culture of policing and the persistence of anti-Black racism form a system that produces deaths like those of Breonna Taylor Atatiana Jefferson Rayshard Brooks and many others. Barring a massive policy shift the racialized police killings and the unrest they spur will likely continue unabated.

What happens to the Supreme Court (and the Constitution) if Trump wins,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/7/21/21328863/supreme-court-trump-vacancy-voting-rights-rnc2020-epa-police,www.vox.com,1600223579509
In 2019 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a gathering of the conservative Federalist Society that President Trump owes his broad support among Republican voters to one issue. “The single biggest issue that brought nine out of 10 Republican voters home to Donald Trump” McConnell claimed “just like nine out of 10 voted for Mitt Romney was the Supreme Court.” McConnell’s “nine out of 10” estimate is almost certainly an exaggeration but there’s no question that Republicans view filling the judiciary with Federalist Society stalwarts as one of their highest priorities if not the highest priority. The GOP-controlled Senate passes little legislation. It rarely even considers bills that arise from a Democratic House. But McConnell has transformed the Senate into a virtual factory that kicks out judicial confirmations almost as fast as Trump can nominate conservative lawyers for the bench. If Trump prevails in November he is likely to remake the courts — and specifically the Supreme Court — in his image. Two members of the Court’s liberal minority Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are in their 80s. And Ginsburg began a course of chemotherapy earlier this year. If Trump wins Republicans could gain a 7-2 majority on the nation’s highest Court by the end of his second term. The stakes if a vacancy does open up on the Supreme Court while Trump is still president are enormous. Though Chief Justice John Roberts frequently the median vote on the current Supreme Court is very conservative he is both less partisan and less aligned with movement conservatism than his fellow Republican justices. He sometimes rejects conservative legal arguments that are poorly reasoned or transparently partisan or that ask him to move the law to the right faster than he is willing to go. If Trump gets to replace a liberal justice however this check on Republican power is likely to disappear. Trump spent the past three and a half years filling federal appellate courts with staunch conservatives often with the guidance of conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society. That gives him a deep bench of potential Supreme Court nominees who are unlikely to disappoint the GOP in the future. The Court has already moved significantly to the right since it handed down some decisions protecting LGBTQ rights limiting police surveillance and preserving most of Obamacare among many other things. If Trump fills a seat currently held by a liberal justice those decisions are potentially in grave danger. To be sure there’s always some amount of unpredictability in the Supreme Court. Sometimes a conservative justice is torn between competing ideological commitments some of which lead them to form occasional alliances with their liberal colleagues. And it’s always possible that several conservative justices could be forced to leave the Court shortly after a Democratic president takes office. But realistically if Republicans gain a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court they are likely to hold that majority for a long time. And with six votes Republicans could afford to have one of those six cast an occasional futile vote for a liberal outcome. Roberts is less tolerant than his fellow Republican justices of bad lawyering by conservatives The Supreme Court completed its most recent term a little more than a week ago a term that featured several high-profile — if narrow — losses for conservative causes. Notably Roberts broke with his fellow Republicans in two cases where conservative advocates presented unusually weak arguments to his Court. Roberts typically votes to limit abortion rights and his recent opinion in June Medical Services v. Russo spends several pages criticizing the Court’s decisions protecting those rights. Nevertheless Roberts reluctantly voted with his four liberal colleagues to strike down a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital — a credential that is very difficult for these doctors to obtain and that does little or nothing to improve health outcomes in abortion clinics. The reason for Roberts’s vote was simple: The Louisiana law at issue in June Medical was in all relevant respects identical to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck down four years earlier in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt (2016). “I joined the dissent in Whole Woman’s Health and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided” Roberts wrote in his June Medical opinion. But he concluded that the principle of stare decisis — the doctrine that courts should generally be bound by their prior decisions — compelled him to strike down Louisiana’s law. A similar dynamic played out in Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California where Roberts joined his four liberal colleagues in holding that the Trump administration didn’t complete the proper paperwork when it decided to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program which allows nearly 700000 undocumented immigrants to live and work in the United States. The striking thing about Regents is the utter pointlessness of the Trump administration’s decision to bring this case all the way to the Supreme Court. If the administration wanted to end DACA it should have corrected its paperwork error instead of spending years unsuccessfully trying to convince the courts to excuse this error. In many cases Roberts’s insistence on legal and procedural regularity will only delay conservative outcomes — Roberts for example is still overwhelmingly likely to dismantle the constitutional right to an abortion once abortion opponents bring him a better case. But Roberts’s formalism also places significant constraints on the Court’s Republican majority and on the Republican Party’s ability to set policy through litigation. As Justice Scalia wrote in 1989: when in writing for the majority of the Court I adopt a general rule and say “This is the basis of our decision” I not only constrain lower courts I constrain myself as well. If the next case should have such different facts that my political or policy preferences regarding the outcome are quite the opposite I will be unable to indulge those preferences; I have committed myself to the governing principle. Roberts appears somewhat committed to this same principle that procedural rules and inconvenient precedents cannot simply be tossed aside because they stand in the way of a conservative outcome. The other four Republicans appear far less committed to this principle given their willingness to cast aside principles like stare decisis in cases like June Medical. And if Trump gets to fill another seat currently held by a liberal justice then Roberts will no longer be the swing vote. It is likely that a majority of the Supreme Court will ignore many of the constraints that as Scalia wrote a generation ago prevent judges from ruling by fiat. America becomes even less democratic if Trump gets to fill another Supreme Court seat The United States is hardly a paragon of democracy. Americans have a president who received nearly 3 million fewer votes than his Democratic opponent in 2016 and a Senate where thanks to malapportionment the Republican “majority” represents 15 million fewer people than the Democratic “minority.” Both of Trump’s justices were nominated by a president who lost the popular vote and confirmed by a bloc of senators who represent less than half of the nation. Meanwhile the Court’s Republican majority has been a disaster for democracy. In this past term alone the Court handed down several significant orders limiting voting rights in a pandemic — including a Texas order that effectively allows the state to make it very easy for older voters (who tend to favor Republicans) to obtain absentee ballots while making it impossible for most younger voters to do the same. Under Roberts’s leadership the Supreme Court dismantled much of the Voting Rights Act. It’s neutered most of the nation’s campaign finance laws. And it’s permitted laws that serve no purpose other than voter suppression. But it can get worse. “There are already five conservative votes on the Supreme Court to dismantle campaign finance reforms” according to Ciara Torres-Spelliscy a law professor at Stetson University and an expert on money in politics. In this sense Torres-Spelliscy told me a third Trump justice would only provide a “superfluous sixth vote” for the Court’s decisions undermining these laws. But there is one area of campaign finance law where the current Supreme Court has stayed its hand: disclosure laws. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) the Court’s landmark decision allowing corporations to spend unlimited sums of money to influence elections Justice Clarence Thomas argued that his Court should have also tossed out many laws requiring many donors to disclose their donations. At the time Thomas was the only justice who took this position but the Court has changed significantly in the decade since Citizens United was handed down. Justice Neil Gorsuch frequently provides a second vote for Thomas’s most radical opinions. Similarly as an aide to then-President George W. Bush Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a 2002 email that there are “constitutional problems” with laws imposing limits on how much donors can give directly to candidates — one of the few campaign finance laws left untouched by decisions like Citizens United. That suggests that Kavanaugh could join Thomas in striking down more campaign finance laws. And then there’s Justice Samuel Alito. Though Alito did not join Thomas’s opinion in Citizens United he is arguably the most reliable Republican partisan on the Supreme Court. As Adam Feldman a lawyer and political scientist who runs the website Empirical SCOTUS told me Alito “is the sole conservative justice on the Court not to join the liberals in a 5-4 decision” — meaning that he has never once cast the deciding vote for a liberal outcome. (The one plausible exception to this trend is Alito’s brief opinion in Gundy v. United States (2019). But in Gundy Alito endorsed a conservative deregulatory project that is rejected by all four of the Court’s liberals.) It is unlikely in other words that Alito would cast a liberal vote in a campaign finance case if four other justices already support a conservative outcome. A third Trump justice could also erect new barriers before the right to vote. Although the Roberts Court has already dismantled much of the Voting Rights Act the primary law preventing racial voter discrimination it has thus far left in place the law’s “results test” which prohibits any law that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.” Thus while the Act is much weaker than it was just a decade ago it still retains some vibrancy. Many state laws that disenfranchise voters of color remain illegal. But Roberts is a longtime opponent of this safeguard against racism in elections. According to the voting rights journalist Ari Berman Roberts was the Reagan Justice Department’s point person in a failed effort to scuttle the results test. As a young lawyer Roberts “wrote upwards of 25 memos opposing” such a test according to Berman. Roberts may have the votes right now to effectively dismantle what remains of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court has not heard a major Voting Rights Act case since the relatively moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy was replaced by the hardline conservative Justice Kavanaugh so we don’t know how far the current Court is willing to go in dismantling what remains of the Voting Rights Act. At the very least however every Republican added to the Supreme Court increases the likelihood that the remainder of the Voting Rights Act will fall. 20 million Americans could lose health coverage in the middle of a pandemic if Trump appoints another justice Chief Justice Roberts famously broke with his fellow Republicans in NFIB v. Sebelius (2012) a decision upholding most of the Affordable Care Act. Three years later in King v. Burwell (2015) Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy broke with their fellow Republicans again to reject a new attack on Obamacare. But Kennedy is no longer on the Court. And if one of the four liberal justices is replaced by Trump it’s far from clear that there will still be five votes to preserve the landmark legislation that provides health coverage to approximately 20 million people. And if Trump does get to fill an additional Supreme Court seat Obamacare could fall quite rapidly. The Supreme Court plans to hear oral arguments in California v. Texas the latest case seeking to repeal Obamacare by judicial decree in the fall. The plaintiffs’ arguments in Texas are frankly outlandish. They rest on the assumption that when Congress repealed a single provision of the Affordable Care Act in 2017 that requires the courts to dismantle the entire law. But the fact that these arguments are widely viewed as ridiculous — even by many conservative legal scholars — won’t necessarily deter most of the Supreme Court’s Republicans from voting to strike down Obamacare. On the eve of oral arguments in NFIB the first Obamacare decision the plaintiffs’ arguments in that case were also widely viewed as misguided. An American Bar Association poll of Supreme Court experts found that 85 percent believed the Affordable Care Act would be upheld and another 9 percent believed the Court would dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. That didn’t prevent four justices from voting to repeal the entire law. And if Trump gets to fill another seat on the Supreme Court that four could become five. LGBTQ Americans could be stripped of their constitutional rights The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Bostock v. Clayton County which held that federal civil rights law prohibits workplace discrimination against LGBTQ workers is probably safe. That decision was 6-3 with both Roberts and Gorsuch voting with the majority. But the Court’s constitutional decisions protecting LGBTQ rights stand on far more precarious ground. Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) the Supreme Court landmark decision establishing that same-sex couples enjoy the same marriage rights as opposite-sex couples was a 5-4 decision with Kennedy in the majority. Lawrence v. Texas (2003) which placed strict limits on the government’s ability to prohibit sexual activity between consenting adults and Romer v. Evans (1996) which held that the government may not pass laws solely to express “animus” against gay people were both 6-3 decisions with Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and Kennedy in the majority. O’Connor and Kennedy were replaced with hardline conservatives. It’s possible in other words that all three of these decisions could fall even if no vacancy opens up on the Supreme Court — although for that to happen a state would likely have to pass a law that violates Obergefell Lawrence or Romer to test whether the Supreme Court would strike that law down. If Trump gets to fill another seat it is even less clear that the Court’s new majority will value stare decisis more than it values a conservative approach to LGBTQ rights. It’s also possible that the Court could leave decisions like Obergefell nominally in place but allow states to deny many rights to LGBTQ Americans. The Court according to Shannon Minter legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights “might permit states to undermine Obergefell by treating married same-sex couples differently in some ways — for example by permitting states to favor straight couples in adoption or family benefits or even in the definition of who is a legal parent.” Minter’s view was echoed by Josh Block a lawyer with the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project. While Block said he does not think a newly constituted Court “would vote to overrule Obergefell completely and allow states to ban marriage outright” he fears that the Court’s new majority “could allow states to treat those marriages differently.” Indeed that’s more or less the approach that Gorsuch took in Pavan v. Smith (2017). Obergefell held that the Constitution protects same-sex couples’ right to marry “on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.” In Pavan a majority of the Supreme Court struck down an Arkansas law that treated married same-sex couples differently than married opposite-sex couples with respect to which names appear on a birth certificate. Gorsuch dissented in an opinion joined by Thomas and Alito. His opinion suggested that states may be able to discriminate against same-sex couples so long as they argue that “rational reasons exist” for the discrimination. The EPA could become a hollow husk As a general rule Congress may legislate in two different ways. The simplest way is to enact a law commanding certain individuals or businesses to behave in a certain way. Thus for example if Congress wishes to limit pollution it can pass a law commanding power plants to install a particular device that reduces emissions. But Congress may also lay down a broad policy and instruct a federal agency to issue relatively easily updatable regulations implementing that policy. The Clean Air Act for example provides that certain power plants must use “the best system of emission reduction” that currently exists while also taking into account factors such as cost. It also gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the power to issue binding regulations instructing energy companies on which systems they must use to limit emissions. That way the regulations can adapt as technology evolves. Congress still sets the overarching policy — the impacted power plants must use the “best system of emission reduction” — but EPA determines what that “best system” is at any given moment in time. In Gundy v. United States (2019) however Gorsuch called for vague new limits on Congress’s power to delegate regulatory power to agencies. And while Gorsuch’s opinion in Gundy was technically a dissent all five members of the Supreme Court’s Republican majority have since signaled that they are supportive of Gorsuch’s approach. Current precedents typically require courts to defer to Congress’s decision to delegate regulatory power to an agency. Gorsuch would replace these precedents with a new standard providing that a federal law permitting agencies to regulate must be “‘sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress the courts and the public to ascertain’ whether Congress’s guidance has been followed.” Under Gorsuch’s approach judges — and ultimately Supreme Court justices — would get to decide which federal laws delegating power to an agency are “sufficiently definite and precise” and which ones should be struck down. So it will matter a great deal who sits on the Supreme Court. In a post-Gundy world courts will have far more power to make discretionary calls about which regulations they wish to uphold and which ones they wish to strike down. That means that a more conservative Court will tend to strike down more regulations favored by Democrats. Police could gain far more power to engage in surveillance The current Supreme Court is arguably more friendly to criminal defendants than it was 20 years ago. For many years the Court was dominated by conservatives incubated in the “tough on crime” rhetoric preferred by presidents like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. The current Court by contrast is more likely to see criminal justice cases through a libertarian lens. A big reason for this libertarian turn is that individual conservative justices hold defendant-friendly views on certain criminal justice issues. Roberts often votes with his liberal colleagues in cases where police use new technology to conduct intrusive searches. Gorsuch wrote the lead opinion in a case holding that criminal defendants may only be convicted by a unanimous jury. Kavanaugh is a longstanding opponent of racial jury discrimination. While it’s important that justices like Gorsuch and Kavanaugh sometimes take a broad view of the rights of criminal defendants at trial Roberts’s support for limits on police conduct is likely to prove more consequential — because the overwhelming majority of criminal suspects never receive a trial to determine their guilt. “97 percent of federal cases and 94 percent of state cases end in plea bargains with defendants pleading guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence” according to a 2012 analysis by the New York Times. So Supreme Court decisions protecting trial rights only impact a small minority of defendants. The gap between Roberts and his fellow Republicans was most on display in Carpenter v. United States (2018) where Roberts voted with his four liberal colleagues and held that police “must generally obtain a warrant supported by probable cause” before obtaining cellphone records that can be used to track an individual’s movement. Carpenter was a significant case because as Justice Kennedy wrote in dissent the Court has typically held that “individuals have no Fourth Amendment interests in business records which are possessed owned and controlled by a third party.” But Roberts recognized that as police gain more and more technologically sophisticated methods of tracking criminal suspects the Constitution must recognize new limits on these methods. It’s one thing to say that police can track every number dialed on a particular phone but it’s another thing altogether to say that police can turn each individual’s cellphone into a homing device that monitors their every movement. If Roberts is no longer the swing vote Carpenter could potentially fall. At the very least the Court is likely to grow less skeptical of police overreach and less fearful of the awesome surveillance power given to police by new technology.

Why police encouraged a teenager with a gun to patrol Kenosha’s streets,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/8/27/21404117/kenosha-kyle-rittenhouse-police-gun-populism,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Kyle Rittenhouse the 17-year-old charged with murder in the shooting deaths of two people during the violent protests in Kenosha Wisconsin had a run-in with the police earlier in the night — an extremely friendly one. In footage from about 15 minutes before the shootings pieced together by the New York Times’s Visual Investigations team you can see Rittenhouse walk up to an armored police vehicle and chat with officers. A police officer pops out of one vehicle’s hatch and tosses bottles to Rittenhouse’s associates members of an armed militia. “We appreciate you guys we really do” the officer says before driving off. The young-looking Rittenhouse is under the legal age for firearm ownership and was carrying an assault rifle which appears to be a misdemeanor under Wisconsin law. Instead of stopping him and asking for proof of age the police give him water and an attaboy. And when he tried to surrender after the shootings the police went right by him even as bystanders were telling them that Rittenhouse had shot people. How can we understand this behavior? Why do the police in Kenosha seem perfectly fine with armed militia members patrolling the streets — behavior that just minutes later ended with two people dead? Shouldn’t police want to be the only ones with guns? A recent paper by University of Arizona sociologist Jennifer Carlson offers some insight into the police’s behavior. She conducted dozens of hours of interviews about guns with 79 police chiefs in three states — Michigan California and Arizona — to try to better understand the way police see armed civilians. Carlson found that police leaders tended to see armed civilians as allies maybe even informal deputies — provided they fit a set of racially coded descriptors. “Police chiefs articulated a position of gun populism based on a presumption of racial respectability” Carlson writes. “‘Good guys with guns’ were marked off as responsible in ways that reflected white middle-class respectability.” This helps us understand what happened in Wisconsin as not a bug in the code of American policing but a feature. There’s a reason anti-police violence protesters have been met with crackdowns while armed anti-lockdown protesters could menace the Michigan Capitol without incident. Police — who are heavily white heavily male and overwhelmingly conservative politically — see guns as a scourge when they’re in the wrong hands. But the “wrong hands” tend to be Black and brown ones. When respectable-seeming white people arm themselves police welcome their intervention — even or perhaps especially in a tense situation where the potential for escalation to violence is really high. This is not a new phenomenon; there’s a long history of deeply racialized gun politics in America. In 1967 a group of Black Panthers carried guns in a demonstration outside the California statehouse; shortly thereafter then-Gov. Ronald Reagan signed a bill banning open carry of loaded firearms. Carlson’s study illustrates how this racial gun politics operates at the level of the streets as well as the statehouse. Officers have significant discretion in how they choose to react to different situations; this discretion is often used in racist and violent fashion. The way the police seemingly encouraged Rittenhouse’s vigilantism is a microcosm of some of the most fundamental problems in American policing. The “gun populism” of American police In her research Carlson distinguishes between two kinds of attitudes police have toward civilian ownership of firearms. The first “gun militarism” sees armed individuals as a threat to blue lives. “It favors a state monopoly on legitimate violence whereby police both protected and expanded their own access to firearms while policed and delimited gun access among the racialized urban populations targeted by the War on Crime” she writes. At other times the police chiefs she interviewed embraced “gun populism”: the idea that “rather than a threat to stability (as under gun militarism) armed civilians may be imagined as generative of social order.” Gun populism is an “embrace of ‘the people’ and a deep suspicion of elites especially elite lawmakers who aim to regulate gun access in the United States.” In essence it’s the National Rifle Association view of gun rights. These two frames might seem contradictory. How can you believe both that widespread gun ownership poses a threat to your officers and oppose regulations that aim to limit it? Typically officers got around this dilemma by reference to legal and illegal uses of firearms. The chiefs supported throwing the book at armed criminals believing that anyone who uses a gun in commission of a crime should face serious jail time. But gun ownership itself should be permitted and maybe even encouraged. But here’s the thing: When they talked about gun-wielding criminals the racialized nature of the language was unmistakable. The criminals they were worried about were described as “urban terrorists” “gangbangers” and “illegal immigrants”; their descriptions of respectable gun owners had a very different racial valence. “I am not worried about the people who just want an assault weapon for the hell of it or a military guy who had an M16 and wants one because it reminds him of his old gun” one California police chief said. “I’m worried about the gangster who brings in guns and then it gets into the hands of people who have hatred for America” This bifurcation between minority-coded bad guys and presumptively white good guys led chiefs to take a generally positive view of civilian gun owners who didn’t fit their criminal stereotypes. In Michigan which borders Wisconsin and has similar gun laws police chiefs embraced a vision of gun populism that saw civilian gun owners as their allies. “Michigan chiefs insisted that even the best-resourced police cannot protect all victims at all times and thus opted to devolve some prerogatives onto private civilians as part of their overall crime-fighting mission” Carlson writes. “They understood the capacity among civilians for private legitimate violence as supplementing public legitimate violence.” A comment from one Michigan police chief who works in a majority-white neighborhood crystallized the sentiment. “I believe that citizens need to be able to protect themselves. We cannot protect them — we just can’t. It’s impossible” the chief said. “The government cannot save people from danger. That is just ridiculous. So people should be allowed to defend themselves.” As with all forms of right-wing populism however the real action is in the definition of “the people.” Certain kinds of people tend to be seen as legitimate rights-bearers as people who presumptively deserve the benefit of the doubt when carrying weapons. Others don’t. And that’s where things get dicey. How “gun populism” helps us understand the police reaction in Wisconsin In November 2014 Cleveland police officers shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice who was Black from point-blank range. The police who had described Rice as “maybe 20” on the radio claimed they feared for their life because he was holding a “black revolver.” It was actually a toy gun. The contrast between the treatment of Rice and Rittenhouse couldn’t be clearer. Rice scanned to police as a threat despite being a child with a toy gun. Rittenhouse a teenager with an actual rifle did not. Now Cleveland and Kenosha are different places with different police officers; there are lots of reasons the ending to these two stories wasn’t the same. But there’s ample reason to believe that the mental shortcuts and stereotypes officers have for what kinds of people with guns are threats really do affect the way they treat people — for whether they default to “gun militarism” or “gun populism” in how they treat an armed civilian. The reasons are rooted in basic human psychology. Police officers work a difficult job for long hours called upon to handle responsibilities ranging from mental health intervention to spousal dispute resolution. While on shift they are constantly anxious searching for the next threat or potential arrest. Stress gets to them even off the job; PTSD and marital strife are common problems. It’s a kind of negative feedback loop: The job makes them anxious and nervous which damages their mental health and personal relationships which raises their overall level of stress and makes the job even more taxing. According to Phillip Atiba Goff a psychologist at Yale University and the CEO/co-founder of the Center for Policing Equity research organization it’s hard to overstate how much more likely people are to be racist under these circumstances. When you put people under stress he said they tend to make snap judgments rooted in their basic instincts. For police officers raised in a racist society and socialized in a violent work atmosphere that makes racist behavior all but inevitable. “The mission and practice of policing is not aligned with what we know about how to keep people from acting on the kinds of implicit biases and mental shortcuts” he says. “You could design a job where that’s not how it works. We have not chosen to do that for policing.” American police have a distinctive culture and ideology: a set of attitudes and biases that shapes the way they treat civilians. “Gun populism” is one part of that ideology. And in Kenosha it seems to have influenced their decision-making — apparently leading them to encourage an underage gun owner to go into a dangerous situation with predictable and tragic results.

The power of the Black athlete, explained by the writer of High Flying Bird,headline,https://www.vox.com/culture/21417237/nba-walkout-strike-tarell-mccraney-interview-harry-edwards-high-flying-bird,www.vox.com,1600223579509
The extraordinary sight of NBA players protesting racial injustice by refusing to participate in playoff games last week made me (and others) think about a movie I saw last year. High Flying Bird tells the story of an NBA rookie whose first season is thwarted by the 2011 NBA lockout and his agent (played by André Holland) who is trying to keep his job find a way to retain his clients and also maybe break an unjust system. The story was Holland’s idea; he passed it along to playwright and screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney best known in the movie world for co-writing the Oscar-winning screenplay for Moonlight. (McCraney is also the chair of playwriting at the Yale School of Drama.) Holland also gave McCraney a book that turns up prominently in the film: The Revolt of the Black Athlete published in 1968 by sociologist Dr. Harry Edwards. A game-changing work of both scholarship and activism the book is a study of and call for Black athletes to participate in collective action aimed at social change. Among many other accomplishments Edwards helped engineer the famous Black Power salute that Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised at the 1968 Olympics. High Flying Bird raises important questions about what Holland’s character calls the “game on top of the game” — the business of pro basketball in which players owners media and others all play different roles and have different access to resources and power. Directed by Steven Soderbergh it’s a crackling film that suggests that second-order game could be illusory if athletes start to work together. That realization is prompted by the lockout which was a mini-apocalypse back in 2011 prompted by disputes over the division of revenue between owners and players. The situation the league found itself in 2020 was much stranger with shortened seasons and reduced revenue thanks to the pandemic and Black Lives Matter uprisings across the country in reaction to police shootings. So I wanted to ask McCraney what he was thinking about as the events of last week’s walkouts unfolded. I spoke with him over Zoom about the film’s relationship to our reality the power that Black professional and college athletes hold and the power that’s still outside their grasp how social media changes the game and whether artists have something to learn from the collective action of athletes. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. What were you thinking about last week as you watched the NBA walkouts unfold? I wondered what it must be like for Dr. [Harry] Edwards who chronicled this phenomenon amongst Black athletes throughout the history of the United States — I just kept thinking “I wonder what’s going through his mind.” I know he has a very deep interest in telling stories and points of view like we did in High Flying Bird about the collective power of those athletes and about the social change they can bring and want to bring. Then I started wondering what those players are going through. To be in a bubble in Orlando not able to move and then have your hometown going up in flames or protests happening and you not being able to be there. Even if it’s not your hometown — even if it’s a town that has become your home base because of the team — there’s social unrest happening around people who look like you. As we know these players experience it all the time even if they may not report it. So I was thinking more about what sparked High Flying Bird. These moments these stories these collisions with capitalism racism the industry. One thing I hadn’t thought about much until this year is something André Holland’s character says in the first scene of High Flying Bird: that NBA players have a certain amount of power because the league relies on their image to be able to sell sneakers and merch for the “sexiest sport.” I watched The Last Dance in the spring and showing how much power Michael Jordan had was a big part of the documentary. It was clear that his celebrity and power were very individual. But right now the collective actions aren’t about the individual at all; they’re about the collective. I am not a basketball scholar. But one of the reasons the research [for High Flying Bird] came to me easily was that there are a lot of comparable markets [to pro sports]. Freelance writers. The WGA and agency dispute — that was happening at the same time. We were literally looking at looming actor strikes. Michael Jordan has a great deal to do with this but the rise of the superstar athlete especially in the NBA has created a kind of tiered power system in which you need a star player. You can look at ballet companies the same way: There has to be a prima. There has to be somebody who’s the star that’s going to draw the audience. But you still need the corps you need the ensemble. The interesting thing about how that power works is that it’s endemic to the way we run our society. We mete out freedom to a few people and then everybody else is scrambling for the scraps. But there’s a point where people are like “Wait a minute together we all need freedom. Yes we can talk about different tiers of payment. But we all need human dignity respect the freedom to be our full person.” There are moments like now where everybody’s vying to figure out “Okay well what’s the collective gonna do?” There are folks who are going “We should all just walk away.” And there are people saying “No I’ve got to pay my bills.” That’s where the tensions lie. That’s where the system wants you to be. It wants to keep us in a constant state of saying “Hey don’t rock the boat here; some of us don’t have the privileges you have.” It’s always important to remember the way capitalism works in these industries: It wants you to think it supports the individual but that’s not true. It can’t. It’s not possible. That’s why we call the one percent “the one percent.” If we keep everybody vying to be the one percent keep everybody pulling to be there they’re so distracted that nobody’s paying attention to the fact that the 99 percent is being treated like less-than-human beings. How great would those players be if they were just able to focus on being their best player selves? But they can’t. They absolutely should be doing what they’re doing which is making the people they work for and work with pay attention to the pain and suffering of the communities that they came from and that they are a part of. One thing that struck me watching everything that’s going on and then rewatching High Flying Bird is that our imaginations have been wired so that we often can’t even conceive of what would happen if a group of people who were calling for justice just walked off the job. Or if a large group of people suddenly decided they weren’t going to participate in an unjust system anymore. Or if athletes or artists decided to sidestep an unequal industry rather than work inside it. It’s hard to imagine that as even a possibility. In the movie that realization comes because the NBA is literally in the midst of a lockout due to contract disputes so the system is effectively not even there. The similarities [between the movie and now] are terrifying because something larger has stopped what is normal. In our world today many things could interrupt the cash flow of many industries. We’re all going through them including the NBA. But they’re trying to continue to march forward in the middle of a pandemic. In the middle of 180000 deaths and rising there is this feeling that we have to keep the tap on. But that is its weakness. The industry isn’t able to change and move. It doesn’t have flexibility. It has to keep forward momentum. These are moments when we’re trying to tell nature “Oh we’ll find a way to do what we need to do” but things around us really should tell us to stop to reconfigure. This is a moment to look at how we can make things better more equitable. It’s a time that we can just stop. But many industries are like “That’s the opposite of what we can do.” We’re going to hurt ourselves we’re going to extend ourselves even more and take away more freedom and broadcast from people’s homes now if we have to because we’re not going to stop the flow. We can’t. What will we do? If you know that the system is vulnerable in that way then you can really interrupt it if you go “Well you want this to keep going but what if I said no?” And yes the collective action could lead to you not being employed anymore. But do you really want to be employed by a system that vulnerable? A system that can’t stop and say “Hey we’re running wrong we need to stop for a second and figure things out.” Capitalism is like “Well it’s too big to fail.” But every time we get into a “too big to fail” situation and it does fail nobody sees the writing on the wall. We could have seen in advance that something was too big that some small cog would really mess it up and it would send a lot of people reeling. That we need to do something now. But nobody ever does. In these moments of collective action when players in all kinds of sports even in the MLB decided to walk off it looked like solidarity across sports. But I guarantee you there are a lot of people in the background screaming “We can’t let this go on too long. There’s too much money at stake.” I wonder though — none of the major leagues can be making much money right now right? How much must they be making in contrast to what they normally make in order to tell themselves that playing games is the right thing to continue doing? Is it worth it? Those are the questions that keep going through my mind. They’re not operating an ordinary system so what’s the margin here? What’s making this beneficial? Are you wearing out players just to say you’re doing it? The situation has made me think a lot about the powers that college athletes wield both in these times and others since they’re not even getting paid. Oh for sure. They definitely do. There are whole schools that are terrified right now that they won’t be able to operate in general because their sports teams can’t operate. There was this highly recruited student who just went to visit a historically Black college instead of the Top 10 schools or the Big Three that people thought he should have been looking at. People were going crazy: “What? He can’t go to that school. If he goes there then…” You get this nauseous feeling in your stomach thinking “Wow that person is just dollar signs to your institution.” If schools aren’t about higher learning and deepening education are they really just investment funds hedge funds masked as universities? I argue about this even with the institution I work for Yale all the time. Like what’s happening here? Where are our values? I think Dr. Edwards speaks so eloquently about the way in which these young players especially in college have more collective freedom than they think. But the game is to make sure that they don’t know that. Also there’s a burden on them. There are many players who know they’re bringing home championships or making sure their team is in the playoffs and that they’re bringing the stadium money the money that the teams get from endorsements. The revenue that schools get from athletics — those numbers are terrifying. I don’t know what those schools’ values are I don’t know what their ethos is. But there’s something really powerful in what’s happening there in the ways in which these young folks are beginning to think about both their collective action and their actions as individuals. I know Dr. Edwards has lots to say about that. One big element of High Flying Bird — and also an element of the power that athletes can yield these days — came with the advent of social media which gave people a new way to own their images. They weren’t as easy to control as they might have been in the past. The age of information like all periods in history has its pluses and minuses or gifts and curses. The internet the amount of information that we get the ability to shift that information and pass it back and forth — there’s never been another time like it. Our brains are so stimulated by that passing of information. And to think that artists athletes or anyone creative isn’t going to engage that with some sort of individualist mindset is wrong. As people who are in the entertainment industry we have been asked to be quieter about our interior feelings about specific issues — understandably so. But right or wrong [through social media] we get to see people’s innermost thoughts. It’s kind of interesting that colleges used to be the place where people go and find their voice whereas a lot of college athletes find that’s where people are asking them to be the most quiet. For Black people — for Black artists and Black athletes in particular — there is a kind of urge to engage in that way. And they have every right to and should be able to. You also get to see people on the same team arguing an issue from polar opposite directions. As we saw in The Last Dance those arguments used to stay in the locker room or behind the scenes. People would guess about them and then every now and then a journalist would find the story and run it in the Chicago Tribune or something. But now we can see arguments play out over tweets flying back and forth. And I think because we are being allowed into that it’s giving us more space and time to remember that athletes are people. You can look at the comments under any [political post from an athlete] and see people from every side of the issue who just want everybody to go back and shut up and dribble. You’ll see a Black athlete saying “Yo these riots aren’t good” and then people who call themselves liberals will write “Oh just shut up and play basketball.” Then there’ll be someone who wants to kneel with Kaepernick who thinks that the NBA or the NFL need to do better and then you’ll see all these comments from the right saying “You need to shut up and do what you do. Keep to your sports.” That’s interesting to me because it means that there’s a mechanism on both sides that shuts off that person’s humanity and just wants them to be a player just wants them to be a musician and not a fully human person in the world. That again is that veil of capitalism. You provide me a service. You are my grocer. I don’t want to hear about your personal political struggles as I’m getting my oatmeal. It’s wild to me that we live in a society where on the one hand we want to struggle for those freedoms and at the same time we don’t want everybody else to have them. That seems relevant far beyond sports. You work in the arts and the entertainment industry and I write about it and often I see people saying things like “We pay you to entertain us. Just entertain me. Don’t make me feel uncomfortable. Which of course is ludicrous when you’re talking about theater and film— —whose purpose is literally to make you feel uncomfortable. If I don’t make you feel uncomfortable in some way making you laugh won’t be easy. If I don’t make you feel uncomfortable making you cry won’t be easy. The whole point of me doing this work is that at some point I’ve got to make you feel like you’re not sitting in a place that you sit every day and think about the things you think about every day. I’ve got to take you out of your comfort zone in order to get you to move think feel slightly different. Sorry I interrupted your question. No you’re totally right! So given that do you think there are lessons that Black artists can take from athletes or from Dr. Edwards in the very white-dominated worlds of theater and film? Yes. I hate to be that short but it’s really the truth. Look the thing that Dr. Edwards talks about the most is that he’s an advocate for Black participation in management. And even I will look around sometimes and be like “Where are all the Black people?” I’ll look at my executive producers and be like “What’s happening?” Sometimes it’s a hard thing to say because you build good relationships with your white colleagues all the time. But at the same time at some moments I’m just like we’ve got to start building these collectives. You’ve got to start talking to other people. You start building those collectives. You start talking to the other people who are at the same level of you in the job and say “Hey who are your people? Who are your managers your agents your lawyers?” You start slowly trying to figure out how to build more infrastructure. Because to be honest what ends up happening [in the industry] is less about a kind of overt racism. That happens for sure. Don’t ever think that it doesn’t. Overt racism happens at every level in all industries. It’s just less frequent. People have gotten better about it. When it does happen even if it isn’t “overt” it’s still violent. The harm is still done. And it’s hard to explain that an action is harmful when people have decided it’s benign. Even when you’re negotiating contracts or deals folks will tell you “Oh you’re going to go into the room and they’re going to ask for a discount[ed rate].” And you think to yourself “Wait a minute why am I being asked for a discount? Why am I being discounted already? I just came in the room. You don’t even know what I’m selling.” But you know. It’s because I’m Black. Then you start thinking to yourself “Well I need to start selling to more Black people because then I don’t need to discount anything.” As an artist who wants to be paid I enter a negotiation saying “Hey this is how much this thing is going to cost; this is how much time it’s going to take me.” I know very few artists who are going in there and being like “I got this really dumb thing that I’m gonna go in and pitch and I just want billions of dollars for it.” It happens and good luck to those people. But rarely is that the case right? If I’m coming into a project and [I’m upfront about] what it will cost to make then why I’m being discounted for it just because I’m Black? Anyway the moment you start hearing that and knowing that that’s happening you start thinking to yourself “I got to go in the room with people who aren’t going to discount me. I have to have people who are going to fight for me and remind those people why they shouldn’t discount me.” Speaking very personally once André [Holland] thrust this idea into my heart and I started reading The Revolt of the Black Athlete I just started thinking yeah this makes a whole bunch of sense. We fought for 400 hundred years to undo systemic racism yet it’s not going anywhere. We can keep running up against that which becomes exhausting. And then I’m not writing I’m not playing basketball I’m not doing the thing that I’m actually called to do. I’m just running up against the system. Or I can just surround myself with people who don’t want to engage the system in that. That shift has been more subtle for me but I understand those people who are just like “All Black Everything.” I get it. I totally get it. We can pretend those lessons don’t translate from athletics to art but I think that’s to our own detriment. High Flying Bird is streaming on Netflix.

1 in 3 Black Americans knows someone who died of Covid-19. These stories capture the toll taken by the disease.,headline,https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/8/26/21400035/coronavirus-covid-19-mortality-black-americans,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Nationwide protests this summer have brought much attention to a crisis as old as our country — the countless Black lives lost to police violence. But there is another invisible war that Black Americans are losing: the battle against Covid-19. To date more than 5.7 million people have been reported to be infected with the disease in the US; more than 178000 have died. And the country’s most vulnerable communities have had to bear the brunt of America’s failure to contain the disease. According to a June Washington Post poll one in three Black Americans personally knows someone who has died of Covid-19 compared to 17 percent of Hispanics and 9 percent of white adults who said they have lost a friend acquaintance or loved one to the disease. Yet the disproportionate toll the coronavirus has taken on communities of color was easy to anticipate. From historical redlining and segregation that created environments where Black people are packed into densely populated housing “projects” to the wealth gap spurred by years of discriminatory practices to systemic health care discrepancies it is clear that Black America has long been battling to survive. For many Black Americans the impacts of the pandemic are compounded. Many have one or more family members who have died of the disease on top of neighbors friends friends of friends or others in their communities. Facebook feeds are full of posts announcing another death another virtual funeral another remembrance page. “Every time you look up there is another RIP post or a friend seeking prayers for their loved one who is battling this cruel virus” said Desha Hargrove of Detroit who lost her husband to Covid-19 in March. “I am simply devastated at how this virus has mainly impacted our communities.” We asked three Black people who lost loved ones to share what it’s like to experience multiple deaths sometimes within families neighborhoods or larger communities — and what it’s like to cope often from a distance. These are their stories. “I lost the greatest love of my life and unfortunately have also been deeply affected by the loss of five others” Desha Hargrove Detroit Michigan Lost her husband Jason Hargrove Michigan like states all across the US did not implement strict mask mandates in a timely fashion. On July 10 months after Desha Hargrove’s husband Jason died Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive order requiring businesses to refuse service in most cases to customers not wearing masks. By then the state had reported more than 67000 confirmed cases and more than 6000 deaths with Detroit — a mostly Black city — taking the biggest hit. Jason and I knew each other for 23 years and we were happily married for 12. We were introduced through mutual friends — the friends didn’t last but Jason and I did. I would describe Jason as a loving gentle giant so much fun. He loved to DJ and was a great father to our five children. When the reports started coming out about this virus nobody understood what was going on. You were hearing about this “flu-like” bug so we put in our minds that it was just a flu but a stronger strain of it. Still we knew we had to take precautions because he was a [bus driver] public worker. Initially there was no order in place and masks weren’t required. But Jason was very careful and made sure to spray surfaces with disinfectant and even wear gloves. He put up a message on social media one day saying a lady was coughing on the bus carelessly telling people to cover up and wear masks to protect themselves and him. That day when he came home he was really distressed about her coughing. He sat the rest of the day in disgust. I tried to comfort him. The next two days Jason started to feel funny. He told me he felt like he was coming down with a cold. I started laughing and told him “Don’t you start that.” I knew he could sometimes be such a big baby and I thought he was exaggerating. But that Sunday he was really tired. He liked to DJ so I pushed so much that night for him to play music. He got on live did a video. We had fun until about 2 am. By Monday morning it was coming down on him and by the next day he had a high fever. I took him to the emergency. I didn’t get out of the parking lot before he called me and told me he was ready for me to come pick him up — it was that fast. They told him to go on a 14-day quarantine and gave a prescription for Tylenol and a prescription for high blood pressure because his pressure was high. When I asked if they tested him he said no. He went home and started home remedies and he called his job to let them know — he was still worried about work. Not too long after I noticed his cuticles were blue and took him to emergency again. It was an extremely beautiful spring day in Detroit and many people were out on the streets. I was so angry at them. During his second visit to the ER they listened to his lungs and said they were clear and that the fever would break. They didn’t test him again. The next day Jason asked me to set him up in another room in the house because he didn’t want to get me sick. That was so hard for me. It was even harder when I heard him crying in the bathroom. He was crying so hard and praying asking God to remove whatever sickness is in his body. “What is this? Take this out of my body” he pleaded. He went to the hospital again and he was finally admitted. The hospital never called. They never let me know anything. I called and called and called. When I finally got through to a nurse and asked to talk to my husband she told me he couldn’t talk because he was on a ventilator like all of the patients on that floor. Still one of the nurses assured me he was going to be “just fine.” The next morning was April 1 and I called first thing. I got the run-around for over an hour. First they told me there was no one by that name on the floor then they put me on hold several times. Finally a doctor broke the news to me that my husband had passed. “Please tell me this is April Fools’ Day” I thought to myself. They never called me. I never got one update. Then I saw Jason all over the news. His video message [a YouTube video telling people to wear masks on the bus] had gone viral. I saw the mayor do a news conference on him but nobody called me his wife. When I finally got the death certificate I found out he died on the 31st — the day they said he was doing so well. He died only an hour after and no one ever reached out to his family. You tell me: Did this Black life matter? My life has been greatly impacted by this terrible virus. I lost the greatest love of my life and unfortunately have also been deeply affected by the loss of five others — all of whom were Black beautiful human beings. I am simply devastated at how this virus has mainly impacted our communities. I am still asking “Why?” Every time you look up there is another RIP post or a friend seeking prayers for their loved one who is battling this cruel virus. Just horrifying! “The response [from the government] seems to convey ‘Let them die’” Cassandra White Houston Texas Lost her wife Vickey Gibbs In Houston Texas — where two of Desha’s children virtually attended a service for their father — Cassandra White is still reeling from the loss of her wife Vickey Gibbs a church pastor. Houston is another city where the disease has disproportionately claimed the lives of Black people. A breakdown of fatalities by race revealed that 57 percent of those who have died in the city of Covid-19 were African American. For a system that is not set up to actually be “equal” it’s expected that more Black people would hurt from the pandemic. Vickey was a voice for many people of color. She was the advocate. She spoke up. She was that presence. She had already been living with systemic lupus and lived longer than expected so she was very careful. She wore gloves sprayed disinfectant used hand sanitizer and washed her hands. She was also still very active as much as she could be. It saddens me and upsets me. We are a people who thrive in community bonding. Whether it’s at home at the family cookout or the Sunday church service being in community and being with family of birth or by choice is our superpower and currently our downfall. Anytime she could be on the front lines with the movement there would always be people who would follow her. She spoke for marginalized folks and was constantly emailing and writing letters to senators. On June 30 she took a test. Right around that time Sahara dust was coming through so we weren’t really sure [it was Covid-19] until we got the results. We were both in denial about it. When I found out she was positive I was angry because of all of the things we avoided in order for her to not get it. She was always in pain but learned how to manage that pain successfully. Having the virus and having lupus she knew full well what the possibilities were by the time it was bad enough for her to go to the hospital. They told me right away that she was very very sick and they would do everything they could to pull her through. They were really honest. They didn’t beat around the bush. The ICU nurses were coming down to help her because everywhere was full. She was never able to get a bed in the ICU. They were hoping to transfer her but everything was booked. The ER was the last place that she wanted to be. I personally feel like we waited too long to get her help. We were both in denial and not having enough information about the disease. Now I want people to know that if you can’t breathe whether you know you’re positive or not chances are it’s pneumonia. Please go to the ER. It’s one of those unfortunate life lessons that we can hopefully help someone else not to have. Even though you may be a fighter you may be able to get through this but there are things you can get at the hospital that will help. The response [from the government] seems to convey “Let them die.” It seems to me that there is a systematic attack on people of color to exterminate us one by one by any means necessary. The government is pushing to reopen schools. And they have and are but at what cost? Our children are our future. But sadly for many Black and Brown people keeping the children at home is not feasible. RMCC has lost three members that I know of. Some other deaths were undetermined. Many others have been very sick and recovered. Many have lost family members and not been able to be with them at the end of their life. For a congregation that had such a large number of deaths during the AIDS epidemic half of the whole it can cause flashbacks to that time when we did not know what was next had so many to grieve at the same time and had both rational and irrational fears of contagion. We are starting two different grief groups at the end of this month. We continue to do curbside service for those needing food from Pride Charities. The demand has grown. “People here don’t have the resources like a middle-class white family” Kern Bruce Spotswood New Jersey Lost his aunt and cousin to Covid-19 The East Coast was the epicenter of the disease when it first arrived on America’s shores with New York and New Jersey taking the hardest hits. In New Jersey a state where about 15 percent of residents are Black about 20 percent of deaths from coronavirus were Black. Newark one of New Jersey’s biggest cities with a high proportion of Black low-income residents reported more than 190000 cases and more than 14000 deaths as of August 25. Kern Bruce’s aunt was among those Black casualties. I lost my cousin and aunt to Covid-19. They both passed within two weeks of each other. When I found out it was just out of nowhere like “Oh your aunt has Covid.” And a few days later it was like “She passed from Covid.” Same thing with my cousin. It shook me to my core. In both situations nobody could go to the funeral. The funerals were held via YouTube. It took me weeks to click on the link to watch it. It was just such a strange way of sending someone off — so removed from what was actually happening. The point of a funeral is not just for the person who died or for the people who passed; it’s a way of coping for families left behind. To grieve together hug. You can’t do that in these circumstances. During quarantine my uncle took my cousin out to the market to run errands. We suspect he contracted it simply by being outside in public. Luckily my uncle didn’t contract it. I wish that people took this more seriously in the beginning. When I first heard about the pandemic the first thing that came to mind was Newark. Newark is my heart. I have so many wonderful experiences there and lived there for years. But sadly I saw the writing on the wall. It has a population of [Black] people who are in low-income circumstances and people living on top of each other. The American health care system has implicit bias in terms of treatment. How was that going to work in the pandemic? People there don’t have the resources like a middle-class white family. People are being turned away from hospitals. Of course poor people are not going to get the same kind of health care as someone who makes 100k a year. The dude who is occupying the White House has made science a political thing. It’s so weird that the richest country in the world is doing so poorly. People who are historically accustomed to things working in their favor they are in a very privileged position. They are so self-absorbed and conditioned to expect things to work for them that something as simple as wearing a mask becomes a whole affront on their freedom. I don’t know what’s going to happen. There’s just this tremendous anxiety. Tiffanie Drayton is a freelance writer. Find her on Twitter @draytontiffanie.

The police shooting of Jacob Blake, explained,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/8/24/21399690/jacob-blake-police-shooting-wisconsin,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Amid America’s summer of protests against police brutality and racism another police shooting of a Black man has gone viral: that of 29-year-old Kenosha Wisconsin resident Jacob Blake. Blake survived the shooting and said in a video taken at the hospital where he is receiving treatment that he has been in “nothing but pain.” “Your life and not only just your life your legs … can be taken from you like this” Blake said in the video snapping his fingers. Blake’s father told the Chicago Sun-Times his son is paralyzed from the waist down. Rusten Sheskey a white officer who is a seven-year veteran of the Kenosha Police Department reportedly shot Blake in the back at close range seven times on August 23. The shooting sparked local protests (during which a 17-year-old vigilante killed two people) reignited national unrest prompted professional athletes to strike and has become a central talking point for Democrats and Republicans as each party attempts to use it as evidence of the other side’s inability to govern. Now the FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting in conjunction with an investigation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. And both Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris have called for Blake’s shooter to face criminal charges. Sheskey and the other two officers on the scene — Vincent Arenas and Brittany Meronek — have been placed on administrative leave. Arenas and Sheskey both shot Blake with Tasers before the latter fired on him with a handgun; Meronek was at the scene. But these developments and their impact on Blake and his family have been eclipsed by a national conversation about what Blake’s shooting means and what the resultant protests say about the state of America. Blake’s shooting captured on video by a bystander quickly went viral and further stoked the ongoing national protests against police brutality and for civil rights that began following the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. In Kenosha protesters were quick to respond to the video. Hours after the shooting took place demonstrators gathered in downtown Kenosha; in the resulting uprising buildings and car lots were set on fire and protesters who launched fireworks clashed with police officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Immediately following that uprising Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers called in the state National Guard to bolster the ranks of local law enforcement and to enforce the city’s curfew. More National Guard members were deployed during the third night of uprisings — a night that saw armed citizens standing guard outside local businesses. One of those citizens 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse of Illinois was arrested and charged with murder in the shooting of three people two of whom died. That shooting in turn has led to an even greater National Guard presence — and to Evers accepting a deployment of federal law enforcement officers amid pressure from President Donald Trump to do so. Trump has cast the uprisings in Kenosha and in other cities as symptoms of mismanagement and has attempted to use them to argue that he is the presidential candidate who will bring “LAW & ORDER!” to the United States. Democrats like presidential nominee Joe Biden have attempted to place the blame for violence adjacent to uprisings at the feet of the president. Blake’s mother Julia Jackson has pleaded for politicians to “fix our country” while condemning the destruction that happened during the early uprisings in Kenosha. “As his mother please don’t burn up property and cause havoc and tear your own homes down in my son’s name” she said on CNN after the first two nights of protests. In Kenosha protesters heeded Jackson’s request but have continued their demonstrations. And across the US Blake’s shooting has given new urgency to demonstrations in other cities and towns sharpening the calls of protesters who say Americans must continue to take to the streets to fight the harmful cycle of police brutality and put pressure on lawmakers to defund the police. Police shot and severely wounded a Black man in broad daylight Police were called to the scene of a domestic incident at 5:11 pm on Sunday in the Wilson Heights neighborhood of Kenosha according to a police report. The Wisconsin Department of Justice notes the police were called to the neighborhood by a woman who requested assistance because “her boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises.” In dispatch audio of the incident a dispatcher can be heard saying “Jacob Blake isn’t supposed to be there and he took the complainant’s keys and is refusing to give them back.” Following the shooting several witnesses told Kenosha News that Blake was trying to break up a “verbal altercation” between two women just after 5 pm. By 5:15 there were three officers on the scene with one requesting more officers be sent. Two videos of the officers’ interaction with Blake have emerged. The first which went viral depicts Blake’s shooting; the second shows some of what happened in the seconds immediately prior. In that second video Blake wearing a white tank top and black shorts can be seen attempting to stand as two officers struggle to force him to the ground; various bystanders shout throughout. After about 15 seconds Blake can be seen standing and walking around the front of a gray van. All three officers on the scene have weapons trained on him; two follow him around the van. This is where the first video picks up. Blake can be seen walking around the front of a gray van coming from the passenger’s side and heading toward the driver’s side. Two officers follow closely behind Blake. Both officers have their weapons pointed at Blake’s back. Many people can be heard yelling. As Blake opens the driver-side door one officer snatches the tail end of Blake’s tank top. It stretches out as Blake attempts to enter the vehicle; seven shots are fired at Blake’s back. No other officer opened fire. The van’s horn blares the officer continues to hold on to Blake’s shirt and a woman screams at the side of the vehicle where Blake was shot. One of the officers pushes the woman away and the 19-second video comes to an end. Blake remains hospitalized. The bullet damage reportedly forced doctors to remove most of Blake’s colon and small intestines; his kidneys liver and arm were also seriously damaged. A statement from the state Department of Justice notes that officers tried to arrest Blake; following the shooting Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis said Blake is currently under arrest “for an outstanding warrant for third-degree sexual assault.” It is not clear whether the officers who were called to Wilson Heights were attempting to arrest Blake due to this warrant. It is clear that they first used Tasers to try to apprehend him; the Wisconsin DOJ statement says the nonlethal weapon “was not successful at stopping Blake.” The police department said in a statement that Blake received immediate aid and was airlifted to the hospital in Milwaukee. The state attorney general Josh Kaul has said Blake noted he had a knife in his possession when the shooting occurred. Officials from the department recovered the knife from the driver-side floorboard of Blake’s vehicle. The Kenosha Police Department does not have body cameras so the officers were not wearing any at the time of the incident according to the statement. Jacob Blake’s family retained civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump who also represents the family of George Floyd. According to a statement from Crump Blake was shot by police in front of his three young sons who were inside the vehicle. “We all watched the horrific video of Jacob Blake being shot in the back several times by Kenosha police” Crump said in the statement. “Even worse his three sons witnessed their father collapse after being riddled with bullets. Their irresponsible reckless and inhumane actions nearly cost the life of a man who was simply trying to do the right thing by intervening in a domestic incident. It’s a miracle he’s still alive.” Meanwhile both Biden and Harris have called for the officer who shot Blake to face charges. “I think that there should be a thorough investigation and based on what I’ve seen it seems that the officer should be charged” Harris said in an August 28 interview. And when asked on September 2 if he agreed with her Biden said that “there’s a minimum need to be charged” and “we should let the judicial system work its way.” Nights of unrest — and the shooting of three people — in Kenosha Protests began the night after Blake was shot on August 23 leading to a number of uprisings and escalating tension with local police. Following the shooting videos on social media showed protests that included garbage trucks being set on fire windows of buildings at and near the courthouse being smashed and crowds clashing with police dressed in riot gear. In response county officials instituted a curfew and Wisconsin’s governor began to deploy members of the Wisconsin National Guard to Kenosha. The city grew more tense in the following nights as organized marches outside the Kenosha County Courthouse gave way to uprisings after the 8 pm curfew. Fires burned in much of Kenosha’s Black business district according to Reuters and protesters used bats to break traffic signals and signs. When the crowd of people reached 1000 at a park near the courthouse police shot small beanbags and used “ear deafening audio” to disperse the people who refused to move according to the Washington Post. The unrest has since spread to other cities including Madison Portland Los Angeles Minneapolis New York and Seattle. On August 25 violence erupted at the protests in Kenosha when a group of men with guns who said they were protecting the property clashed with protesters. Online video footage shows that people were chasing after one of the armed men identified as 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse in an attempt to capture him and seize his AR-15-style rifle. During the chase Rittenhouse trips and falls to the ground where he shoots at a few of the people who were following him. After the shooting he gets up and walks toward law enforcement officials who do not detain him despite bystanders screaming that he had just shot people. Two of three people were fatally hit with the other taken to the hospital with “serious but non-life threatening injuries” according to the Kenosha Police Department. Rittenhouse is a self-proclaimed militia member has ties to law enforcement as a former member of various law enforcement youth training programs and was front row at a Trump rally in January. Rittenhouse’s Facebook profile which is no longer publicly accessible revealed that he is a committed Blue Lives Matter supporter: [...] a 2018 post on Rittenhouse’s page shows that he asked his followers to donate to the police advocacy nonprofit organization Humanizing the Badge on his birthday. “I’ve chosen this nonprofit because their mission means a lot to me and I hope you’ll consider contributing as a way to celebrate with me” Rittenhouse wrote. In a press conference on the Rittenhouse incident Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis tried to shift the blame of the shootings onto the protesters and the people who were shot saying that if protesters had stayed inside the shootings would perhaps not have taken place. “Everybody involved was out after the curfew. I’m not going to make a great deal of it but the point is that the curfew is in place to protect. Had persons not been out in violation of that perhaps the situation that unfolded would not have happened” he said. At the same press conference Kenosha Sheriff David G. Beth responded to the concern that police officers did not apprehend Rittenhouse when he walked past them. “I’ve been in a shooting before. In situations that are high stress you have such incredible tunnel vision. You have no idea what’s outside right here if you’re looking right here” Beth said holding his hands up to gesture. Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian meanwhile said he does not want militia members at protests. “I don’t need more guns on the street in the community when we are trying to make sure we keep people safe” he said. “Law enforcement is trained. They’re the ones who are responsible. They’re the ones we have faith will do their job and make sure it gets done. That is why the curfews are there.” On the national level Republicans are trying to paint the unrest in Kenosha as a preview of Joe Biden’s America even though the shooter was a Trump supporter and the protests are happening during Trump’s presidency. “Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence in American cities. The hard truth is you will not be safe in Joe Biden’s America” Vice President Mike Pence said during the Republican National Convention. Trump went on to tell Americans that the protests show “no one will be safe in Biden’s America.” Biden has rebutted these attacks saying in a speech in Pittsburgh “These are not images of some imagined Joe Biden America of the future — these are images of Donald Trump’s America today. ... He keeps telling you if he was president you’d feel safe. Well he is president — whether he knows it or not.” Police violence is not uncommon in Wisconsin The ongoing protests continued those that began after Floyd’s death and underscored the fact that police shootings of unarmed Black civilians are not new occurrences in Wisconsin a state in which Black people make up just 6.7 percent of the population. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the Milwaukee region has been home to a number of high-profile police shootings — particularly of Black and Latinx men — in the past two decades in which officers were not charged. One of the victims 22-year-old Adam Trammell died in 2017 after officers from the West Milwaukee Police Department broke down the door of his apartment and repeatedly Tased him as he showered. The 2019 police shooting of Ty’Rese West in Racine County just north of Kenosha County also resulted in no charges against the police. A police sergeant stopped West one evening for not having the proper lights on his bicycle. A struggle ensued after the sergeant thought West had a gun. The incident ended when the sergeant fatally shot West. The death sparked protests across Racine County and West’s family has not stopped issuing calls for justice. Years of grassroots organizing after the police shooting of 21-year-old Kenosha County resident Michael Bell in 2004 led to the passing of a Milwaukee law in 2014 that prevents police officers from conducting their own investigations of officer-involved shootings. As in Blake’s case an outside law enforcement body must step in to lead the investigation. But in the wake of George Floyd’s death criminal justice reform advocates have argued that law doesn’t go far enough and protesters have demanded state legislators make changes to the criminal justice system. Some local officials across the state responded to these demands by terminating school district contracts with police officers. In June Evers announced a legislative package that included banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants adding the requirement that officers take deescalation training and putting $1 million in grants toward community-based anti-violence programs according to Wisconsin Public Radio. However lawmakers likely won’t vote on any of the proposals until next year. And the package of bills from the state’s Democratic governor has received little support from the Republican lawmakers who control the state’s legislature. Evers has used Blake’s shooting to call for a renewed focus on race and policing in his state saying “We stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites. ... In the coming days we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long.” But the governor’s statement — and proposed initiatives — have garnered pushback. Pete Deates president of the union representing Kenosha police officers denounced the governor’s statement calling it “wholly irresponsible and not reflective of the hardworking members of the law enforcement community.” Deates asked that people “withhold judgment” about the shooting and let the investigation “play out fairly and impartially.” Despite this response protesters in Kenosha and across the country are still demanding systemic change. Michael Bell Sr. the father of shooting victim Michael Bell told the New York Times following the shooting of Blake “The system is broken. The system here is broken.” Correction August 26: Due to an editing error an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Jacob Blake was fatally shot.

Race, policing, and the universal yearning for safety,headline,https://www.vox.com/2020/9/15/21437156/police-racial-bias-shootings-the-ezra-klein-show,www.vox.com,1600223579509
Our conversation over race and policing — like our conversations over virtually everything in America — is shot through with a crude individualism. Talking in terms of systems and contexts comes less naturally to us but that means we often miss the true story. Phillip Atiba Goff is the co-founder and CEO of the Center for Policing Equity as well as a professor of African American studies and psychology at Yale University. At CPE Goff sits atop the world’s largest collection of police behavioral data. So he has the evidence and he knows what it tells us — and just as importantly what it doesn’t even attempt to measure. He knows what we can say with confidence about race and policing and what we wish we knew but simply don’t. He thinks in systems in contexts in uncertainty — in the bigger harder picture. That’s what this conversation on The Ezra Klein Show is about. What do we know about racial bias in policing? At what levels does it operate? Where has it been measured and what haven’t we even tried to measure? How much of policing is driven by crime rates? How do we think about the conditions that create crime in this analysis and what do we miss when we ignore them? What do we know about the investments that actually make people safe? How do we balance the reality that police do help reduce violent crime with the fury communities have at being overpoliced or victimized by police? How do we experiment with other models of safety carefully and systematically? There’s a lot in this one. This conversation could’ve gone for hours longer. But these are tough issues and they deserve someone who understands both the micro-level data and the macro-level context. Goff does and he shares that knowledge generously and clearly here. An edited excerpt from our conversation follows. The full conversation can be heard on The Ezra Klein Show.

Ezra Klein You recently said that “the way we set up law enforcement is almost the exact way we’d set up an experiment to make you engage in more discriminatory behavior.” Can you talk about why that is? Phillip Atiba Goff Social psychologists at least for the last quarter-century have been making our research smaller and smaller and smaller to make it more and more precise. What that allows us to do is to get the exact situations that are most likely to get everyday people to engage in discriminatory behavior. Things like: I’m tired. If you’re tired your brain gets lazy and you overrely on overlearned associations. So you end up behaving in line with stereotypes. If you’re multitasking if you’re cognitively depleted if your adrenaline is off if you’re in a new situation if you’re being negatively stereotyped because of your membership within a visible group that matters to you — all of those things are really robust predictors [of discriminatory behavior]. You can manipulate them in a laboratory and you will get people to discriminate against Black folks and not white folks across a whole host of different dimensions. But also all of those things are literally the job description for law enforcement. So it is not surprising that we see some pretty significant racial disparities on the other side. It’s exactly what we would predict. In fact most social psychologists would consider that to be cheating. You just added all the things you knew were going to produce bias and you put them all together. Except it’s not an experiment — it’s with people’s lives. Ezra Klein There is an argument on the right from people like Heather Mac Donald that there’s no racial bias in policing despite what the headline statistics say. And often they cite work like the Roland Fryer study from a few years back. Can you give me your gloss on that? How do we know if there is racial bias in policing? And what can we say about where it does or doesn’t show up? Phillip Atiba Goff There is nobody — and I mean nobody — I’ve met who is remotely serious who has the skills to evaluate research who’s looked at actual data who says there’s no racial bias in policing. That’s just not a serious position. That’s like saying there’s no oxygen on Earth and there’s no such thing as the color green. Of course there’s bias in policing. Where there could be a reasonable debate is at what level and at what magnitude. Those are serious questions to which we have the beginnings of some answers. Roland Fryer for all of the things that I think are irresponsible in the way he has written up some of his stuff on policing does not contend that there is no bias in policing. In fact in the first article that he put out — the one that got all the unnecessary undue attention — it was really clear there are loads of racial disparities which probably constitute bias in police use of force. For whatever reason he decided to emphasize that he didn’t see it in use of deadly force. But in every other form of use of force he finds it. So we have to set the table stakes here. No serious person is claiming there’s no racial bias. The people who are claiming that are politically motivated — they’re not really set up to evaluate the science and they’re not interested evaluating the science. There’s not controversy there. If we’re gonna go to where there’s some unanswered questions we should be asking: What are the outcomes where we see bias? Where do we have good evidence and not good evidence? And what are the levels at which bias might exist? Ezra Klein You say the way to think about this is that it operates at three levels. What are those three levels? Phillip Atiba Goff First let me talk about the overall outcomes. When people are talking about use of deadly force that’s a really small percentage of an already small percentage of incidents and small numbers work differently statistically. So I could look at use of force generally and we see incontrovertible evidence of not just disparities but bias. If I look at vehicle stops and pedestrian stops if I look at ticketing and arrests those are biased even when benchmarked against the most conservative benchmarks of crime. Other outcomes might not look biased depending on how you analyze them. But the levels are what we really should be talking about. Police bias works on three levels. First an individual officer may or may not be biased may or may not exhibit bias. If an officer treats Black people one way and white people another way — if they treat Latinos white people and Asian people differently — that’s at the level of the encounter. If you send Black people and white people out under the same circumstances to encounter the police how do they come back? It’s definitely the case that we see bias there but if we restrict our conversations to just biased officers we’re missing the other two levels. The second level is probably the most important one: the level of community. Let’s say I’m a robot officer so I treat everybody I come in contact with exactly the same but I am deployed differently to Black neighborhoods than white neighborhoods. You’re still gonna see racial disparities. That is a form of bias that afflicts Black communities and poor communities tremendously but it’s not going to look like the individual officers are biased. The decision-making and the deployment patterns are biased. And we must be able to hold that to account because policing is fundamentally a neighborhood issue even more than it’s an encounter issue. Ezra Klein When you say deploy differently what do you mean by deployment? Phillip Atiba Goff It could mean a number of different things. So one thing is in these neighborhoods over here you’re going to deploy stop question and frisk. That’s one way. But it also could just be: I want 20 officers per square block right per block over in this neighborhood and one officer per 20 blocks in this other neighborhood. Just the concentration of officers is going to lead to different outcomes. It could also be something like: Everywhere across the city where you see an open-air drug market I want you arresting folks. Now I don’t know when the last time was that you were on a college campus but most college drug use happens in dormitories. It’s an indoor drug market. And even if it weren’t we don’t treat colleges in the same kinds of ways that we treat low-income Black and brown communities. So the same instruction for an officer to bust open-air drug markets is going to afflict some communities different than others just because of the geographic-spatial elements of those communities. That’s the community level at which bias can operate. The last one which I think is harder to conceptualize is the city level. Let’s say everybody in Philadelphia is getting treated the same at the encounter level and every neighborhood in Philadelphia is treated exactly the same. But let’s say across the board Philadelphia cops treat folks more harshly than cops in a city like Bridgeport Connecticut. It’s actually not that hard to imagine. But because percentage-wise there’s more Black people in Philadelphia than Bridgeport you see racial disparities. That’s also potentially a source of bias: We have a different function — literally a different mission — for law enforcement in cities that are a higher percentage of Black and brown than we have in cities that are a higher percentage white. We’ve got to be able to understand each of those levels. Ezra Klein I want to go through some of the objections here. The thing you hear next in this discussion is that this is all generated by crime rates: Officers police more aggressively where there’s more crime and there’s more crime in Black communities. So everything you see here is simply a function of police going where the crime is. What is the relationship between the crime rate of a local community and police violence? Phillip Atiba Goff Before I respond let me just point out that this is the more reasoned version of the question. What you usually hear is “What about Black-on-Black crime?” And the other version of it that is more popular recently is “But what about Chicago?” It’s important to distinguish between the two forms of that question which are good faith and bad faith. The bad-faith version of that question is: Come on you know Black people just deserve it. It’s almost expressly bigoted and it should be treated as such. The bad-faith version so proliferates that people should understand why folks have such a strong and emotional reaction to that form of the question — because it’s meant to indicate that Black people deserve what’s happening to them. But there is another form of it the good-faith version which is: What cops do is go where crime goes and if there is more crime in Black communities which some statistics show shouldn’t we expect that that’s a portion of it? That you have to deal with that seriously. If you don’t deal with that seriously you haven’t been careful in your methodologies. But that’s a solvable empirical question. You can answer that by looking and seeing every piece of the best research from the work done by Andrew Gelman and Jeff Fagan to the work that we did with the Urban Institute to the theoretical models of Cody Ross and John Mummolo and Dean Knox. Every one of them says crime is a big predictor of police deployment and police contact. So is poverty by the way — not that that makes it okay. So poverty and crime are big predictors but in all the cities we’ve ever looked at they aren’t sufficient to explain the racial disparities. Crime and poverty matter but there are still disparities after that. There’s evidence that there’s still bias after that. In some cities crime and poverty predict about 80 percent of the disparity; in other cities crime and poverty rates are about 20 percent. And that means there’s a real difference in how much police behavior and policy is a driver of inequality in policing and therefore in criminal justice outcomes. That’s where the educated conversation in the country should be but we’re nowhere near that. Ezra Klein I’m glad you brought in poverty here because I want to add in what potentially seems to me to be a fourth level though it might be embedded in one of the ones you offered. All the methodology operates once a crime has occurred more or less. But there’s this whole other question of what creates crime itself and what creates criminogenic conditions. We know a bunch about this: Poverty creates crime. Not having health insurance creates crime — you cut crime if you expand Medicaid in different areas. One of the things that has happened in America is that we have used policy — redlining and segregation and disinvestment and job discrimination and more — to create much more criminogenic conditions in Black communities. The outcome of that has been more crime and then we aggressively police those communities in response. We tend to see crime as an individual decision and to some degree it is but we also have good evidence that crime is a social and policy outcome. That seems like another way structural racism shows up in this conversation that can be very hard to track and does not show up in a lot of the studies. Phillip Atiba Goff That’s exactly right. What we choose to make a crime is deeply influenced by the racial legacies of the United States and the ways in which we create conditions for crime are deeply racially biased. So even if you are benchmarking crime what you’re benchmarking is an endogenous variable. So even the things that we find are pretty aggressively conservative estimates of the level of bias that we see out there exactly for that reason: Racial bias is already baked into what we’ve defined as how we’re policing various crimes. The crack versus powder cocaine disparities is the quintessential example. But there’s literally tens of thousands of smaller and bigger examples throughout the codes of different states and different cities. One of the big problems that we had when we first started doing this work at the Center for Policing Equity was just this — they called it the problem of the benchmark or the denominator problem. If a police department beats up Black people four times more often than it beats up white people that’s clearly a problem. But nobody knows how much of that problem is the fault of police as opposed to how much is inequality or discrimination in housing and health care and employment and education. It’s not erasing racism to acknowledge that there are upstream factors that afflict Black communities that are also racist. But our conversations about policing have been so narrow — because our understandings around public safety have been so narrow — that we have erased all the upstream factors that end up showing up as outcomes when we’re talking about policing.

CNBC host Jim Cramer echoed President TrumpDonald John TrumpDemocrats advocates seethe over Florida voting rights ruling Russian jets identified in Trump campaign ad calling for support for the troops Democratic Senate candidate 'hesitant' to get COVID-19 vaccine if approved this year MORE during an interview with Speaker Nancy PelosiNancy PelosiTrump order on drug prices faces long road to finish line Overnight Defense: Dems divided on length of stopgap spending measure | Afghan envoy agrees to testify before House panel | Trump leans into foreign policy in campaign's final stretch Pence seeks to boost Daines in critical Montana Senate race MORE (D-Calif.) on Tuesday calling her "crazy Nancy." Cramer made the remark during a live interview as he questioned her about the odds for a coronavirus relief package. He immediately apologized for the comment saying he had meant to paraphrase Trump but Pelosi noted that the words came out of the host's mouth."What deal can we have crazy Nancy? I'm sorry that was the president. I have such reverence for the office I would never use that term" Cramer said."But you just did" Pelosi replied."Anything the president says is a projection of his own insecurities. He calls other people crazy because he knows he is" Pelosi said. "He's a master of projection. So anytime he says something you say 'Uh-oh that's what he's thinking of himself.' "As he ended the interview Cramer reiterated that he was being “facetious” by saying “crazy Nancy.”“You know I was being facetious when I used the term” Cramer said.“I do” Pelosi said.“The Speaker of the House should not be called that name” Cramer continued. “I don’t even want to use it again.”During the interview the CNBC host pressed Pelosi on why she and Trump wouldn’t try to speak directly while negotiations over a coronavirus relief package have remained stalled for nearly two months.Pelosi maintained that it was more productive to speak with intermediaries like Treasury Secretary Steven MnuchinSteven Terner MnuchinHillicon Valley: Oracle confirms deal with TikTok to be 'trusted technology provider' | QAnon spreads across globe shadowing COVID-19 | VA hit by data breach impacting 46000 veterans On The Money: Battle over timing complicates Democratic shutdown strategy | Biden's plans would increase revenue by T spending by T analysis says | Mnuchin: Now is not the time to worry about deficits Pelosi defends not speaking to Trump for almost a year MORE."What is the point? I mean the president has sent his representatives. If he has confidence in them then I do too" Pelosi said.She also reiterated that direct communications with Trump tend to be unproductive and unreliable."If you're talking to him you're almost wasting your time because it's not going to pan out" Pelosi said.The latest salvo underscores how much relations between the president and the Speaker have deteriorated.Pelosi and Trump have not had an extended conversation in almost a year. Nor have they been in the same room together since February when they both attended the National Prayer Breakfast. That event came two days after Trump’s State of the Union address during which the president appeared to snub Pelosi’s attempt at a handshake and she ripped up a copy of his speech.Pelosi and Trump last met in October 2019 at the White House to discuss the president’s action to move U.S. troops out of northern Syria.During that meeting Pelosi told Trump that "all roads with you lead to Putin" while Trump charged that "I hate ISIS more than you do."Trump later tweeted out a photo of the meeting that shows Pelosi standing up and pointing a finger at the president.Pelosi has repeatedly questioned Trump's mental health and suggested that he needs an "intervention" from advisers and family members.After that October 2019 meeting Pelosi told reporters that "we have to pray" for Trump's health.Pelosi on Tuesday corrected Cramer saying it hasn't yet been a full year since she spoke with Trump and noting that they had an encounter at the State of the Union address."It wasn't a year. That was October when I said to him 'Mr. President with you all roads lead to Putin.' ... And that he took a picture of and sent out to people. Thank you Mr. President" Pelosi said."And I did communicate with him at the State of the Union address" she added.Trump last week defended not speaking directly with Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) about coronavirus relief.

They don't want to make a deal because they think it's good for politics if they don't make a deal" Trump said. "I'm taking the high road by not seeing them. That's the high road."Talks over coronavirus relief including some kind of extension of weekly enhanced federal unemployment insurance payments have stalled since early August with the two sides remaining far apart.Pelosi announced to Democrats earlier Tuesday that the House will remain in session until there is a deal on coronavirus aid. That announcement came as some moderate Democrats have expressed anxiety in recent days about potentially only remaining in session for a few weeks this month until Congress passes a spending bill to avoid a shutdown and leaving Washington until after the November elections.— Updated at 12:48 p.m.,body,http://thehill.com/homenews/house/516493-pelosi-says-trump-calls-other-people-crazy-because-he-knows-he-is,thehill.com,1600223579509

I had him all set. Mattis didn’t want to do it. Mattis was a highly overrated general" Trump said on "Fox & Friends."The president added that he did not regret the decision not to target Assad saying he "could've lived either way." The Syrian leader has overseen the deaths of scores of civilians amid a years-long civil war that has ravaged the country.Journalist Bob Woodward reported in his 2018 book "Fear" that Trump urged Mattis that the U.S. should “f------ kill” Assad following an April 2017 chemical attack on civilians in Syria.Mattis reportedly went along with the president’s demands during the phone call but immediately told aides after hanging up that they would take a “much more measured” approach.Trump was asked about the reporting at the time and said the assassination of Assad was "never even discussed.""No that was never even contemplated nor would it be contemplated and it should not have been written about in the book" Trump said in September 2018.Trump on Tuesday criticized Mattis at length. Mattis resigned at the end of 2018 after Trump abruptly announced he was pulling all U.S. troops out of Syria a decision he later reversed."To me he was a terrible general. He was a bad leader and he wasn't doing the job with ISIS" Trump said. "He was not doing the job in Syria or Iraq with respect to ISIS."Fox News host Brian Kilmeade interjected to praise Mattis as a great American who served his country."I don't say he is a good American or a bad American" Trump replied. "I just say he didn't do a good job.",body,http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/516443-trump-says-he-wanted-to-take-out-syrias-assad-but-mattis-opposed-it,thehill.com,1600223579509

How does every Joe BidenJoe BidenDemocrats advocates seethe over Florida voting rights ruling Trump order on drug prices faces long road to finish line There's no debate: America needs an equitable and resilient government MORE campaign staff meeting start? I imagine everyone takes a solemn oath not to blow the election. And so far it’s working. If Biden has made any mistakes it has been leaving his basement too often.Facing any candidate or incumbent other than President TrumpDonald John TrumpDemocrats advocates seethe over Florida voting rights ruling Russian jets identified in Trump campaign ad calling for support for the troops Democratic Senate candidate 'hesitant' to get COVID-19 vaccine if approved this year MORE running out the clock would be a highly risky strategy — but Trump keeps sabotaging his own momentum and has shown no aptitude for self-discipline.Even more important the national mood which benefited Trump in 2016 is a drag on his prospects in 2020. The simple rule of thumb for campaigns is that undecideds go for challengers. After all the incumbent is a known commodity and re-elections are mostly referenda on the incumbent. Essentially if a given voter hasn’t decided for the incumbent as Election Day approaches the voter will either vote against the incumbent or not vote. That is bad news for Trump who lags in national and swing state polls.The key 2016 polling statistic was the “right track/wrong track” number. In 2016 63 percent thought the country was on the “wrong track.” It should have been no surprise that undecided voters would gravitate to Trump — the de facto challenger. In 2020 the right track/wrong track number is 62 percent wrong track 26 percent right track. Simply put we should expect the “wrong track” voters to move to Biden the non-incumbent.The election is coming down to Arizona Florida Michigan Minnesota North Carolina Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Ohio could flip to Biden but then it’s a rout. Limited polling also shows Nevada’s 6 votes competitive but they are unlikely to make a difference.According to the RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight state polling averages Biden leads Trump in every swing state. If so Biden would win 333 electoral votes to 205. But that is if the polling averages are right and the undecideds split proportionately. If the Trump vote is underestimated how would the election project?The FiveThirtyEight site runs multiple projections to obtain a series of predictive results. The level of complexity is interesting but not really necessary (and introduces its own errors and biases). Taking the current polling three simple projections can be made: best case for Biden; best case for Trump and a middle case.In the best case for Biden the polls are accurate (nobody has posited the existence of “hidden” Biden voters) and the undecideds break along the right track/wrong track lines: 62 percent for Biden and 38 percent for Trump. This split puts every swing state and Ohio in the Biden column and a 351-187 electoral victory. In the middle case Trump’s “hidden” vote is 2 percent. RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight averages disagree on Florida and North Carolina but do keep Ohio in the Trump column. Still a loss for Trump.The best case for Trump assumes 3 percent of voters are secret Trump supporters. Assuming that such voters are declaring as “undecided” and not flat out lying and splitting the remaining undecideds along the right track/wrong track number Trump holds North Carolina and Ohio. Florida would stay with Trump according to the RealClearPolitics average but flip to Biden under the FiveThirtyEight average. Biden would still win 289-249.If we drop the averages and instead look at the most recent state polling by Morning Consult (Sept. 9) Trump is still in trouble. Only Ohio would stay with Trump under any of the three above scenarios and possibly Arizona if the large recent swing to Biden is overstated. Even a best case across the board has Trump losing.Could Trump still turn things around?Theoretically but the underlying numbers are daunting.Voters have consistently shown limited confidence in Biden. Whether handling the coronavirus (33 percent) or dealing with civil unrest (32 percent) Biden is behind with independent voters. But Trump polls even worse on all these dimensions — and the problem for him is that he’s president. Only on the economy does Trump poll better but just barely.As president Trump is expected to solve problems or present a path forward for solutions. Instead Trump just rages and attacks. There is no affirmative plan. As long as Trump presents no action plan or shows any ability to end the chaos the average voter is more likely to take a flyer on the challenger.Trump’s message is that things will only get worse with Biden. That may be true but that message is a tacit admission that things are bad now and he has no fixes.Trump’s “Make America Great Again” was one of the great slogans in campaign history — it was an optimistic message about America and an attack message implying that the country was in trouble. The amount of lampooning it was subject to was just a testament to its power.What’s Trump’s slogan now? He doesn’t have one. He has no optimistic message and as incumbent he owns the chaos.Biden is winning by letting Trump lose.A more disciplined skilled politician would be taking advantage of the overreach and violence of the protesters and the improving situation regarding the coronavirus. A president like Reagan or Nixon would have made a national address (or multiple addresses) with a plan of action and would have kept himself and his entire administration on message.When times were good Trump benefited from being non-traditional and extemporaneous. But now his undisciplined frenetic style is a huge liability and has put a ceiling on his vote.Trump can rage all he wants at Biden and the media but losing will be his responsibility alone.Keith Naughton Ph.D. co-founder of Silent Majority Strategies is a public affairs consultant who specialized in Pennsylvania judicial elections.

Speaker Nancy PelosiNancy PelosiTrump order on drug prices faces long road to finish line Overnight Defense: Dems divided on length of stopgap spending measure | Afghan envoy agrees to testify before House panel | Trump leans into foreign policy in campaign's final stretch Pence seeks to boost Daines in critical Montana Senate race MORE (D-Calif.) on Tuesday sought to heighten the pressure on Republicans to move a new round of coronavirus relief announcing that the House will return to the Capitol next month to vote on another aid package if a bipartisan agreement is struck before the elections. Pelosi stopped short of promising a House vote on a new emergency stimulus proposal before the chamber recesses at the end of September — a tactic endorsed by a growing number of moderate Democrats concerned about the political optics of leaving Washington without acting to address the health and economic fallout of the deadly pandemic. Although the House passed the $3.4 trillion HEROES Act in May — a bill ignored by Senate Republicans — conditions on the ground have changed significantly in the four months since then as the coronavirus death toll approaches 200000 schools struggle to reopen and tens of millions of workers remain unemployed. A growing chorus of centrist lawmakers are wary of returning to their districts just weeks before the elections with nothing new to show. “It’s not acceptable to my constituents for me to say ‘We’re not doing something because four months ago we did the HEROES Act’” Rep. Anthony BrownAnthony Gregory BrownDemocrats demand Esper explicitly ban Confederate flag and allow Pride Native Nations flags Trump tweets key GOP lawmaker has committed to not changing Confederate base names Overnight Defense: Senate passes annual defense policy bill that sparked Trump veto threat | Military has considered two waivers for transgender troops since ban MORE (D-Md.) told The Hill outside the Capitol. “So I’m hearing a lot from my constituents: Relief relief relief. It’s four months later and they don’t even know what’s in the HEROES Act.”“It’s almost insulting to them to say ‘In the HEROES Act we’ve got one trillion for state and local $75 billion for families’ but where is that money?” he added. “They don’t want to hear the obstacle is solely sitting in the Senate.”The strategic approach to the next round of coronavirus aid is splitting the caucus with Democratic moderates — including those in the Blue Dog New Democrat and Problem Solvers groups — pressing for action this month while a large group of liberals and Pelosi loyalists are backing the Speaker’s hard-line resistance to moving a slimmer bill or cutting the HEROES Act into smaller pieces. “I don’t really see the point of negotiating with ourselves” said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) chairman of the powerful Rules Committee.Yet the moderates are finding their voice as the House has returned to Washington this week after a long summer recess. Leaders of the Blue Dog Democrats have for weeks pressed Pelosi and other party leaders to take up another relief bill before the elections. On Monday leaders of the New Democrat Coalition piled on warning that lawmakers in battleground districts could be particularly harmed by congressional inaction. And the heads of the Problem Solvers a bipartisan group of centrists unveiled a new $1.5 trillion aid package on Tuesday designed to pressure leaders in both parties to get moving on an elusive compromise.“We are not in any way attempting to undermine the Speaker's negotiating positions” said Rep. Ann KusterAnn McLane KusterLawmakers press CDC for guidance on celebrating Halloween during pandemic Chinese tech giants caught up in rising US-China tensions Democratic lawmakers introduce legislation to ensure US can mass-produce COVID-19 vaccine MORE (D-N.H.) who heads the New Democrats messaging arm. “Having said that we are taking the position that we want a deal and we don't think we should adjourn until we have it."“We’ve gotta do something” echoed Rep.

The growing unrest prompted Pelosi to announce Tuesday that the House will remain in session until a deal is reached. “We are committed to staying here until we have an agreement” she told CNBC’s Jim Cramer. The practical effects of the announcement however will likely be slight.House Majority Leader Steny HoyerSteny Hamilton HoyerRaces heat up for House leadership posts Hillicon Valley: Election officials prepare for new Russian interference battle | 'Markeyverse' of online fans helps take down a Kennedy | GOP senators unveil bill to update tech liability protections Google Apple eBay to meet virtually with lawmakers for tech group's annual fly-in MORE (D-Md.) acknowledged that most lawmakers will likely return to their districts when the scheduled session ends on Oct. 2 leaving party leaders seeking to hash out an agreement with the White House. If such a deal emerges then members would be called back to Washington. In that sense the dynamics would look very similar to those surrounding the long August recess when the Capitol was virtually empty.“You could look at it as a distinction without a difference of the last few months” Hoyer said on a press call. “But in another sense it tells members ‘Look we know the election’s coming up we know you want to go back and campaign. But understand this is a priority ... and that we are going to address it as soon as we possibly can.’” Both Pelosi and Hoyer also conducted back-to-back phone briefings with the New Democrats on Tuesday afternoon outlining the party’s plans for the remainder of the month. On that call Pelosi vowed not only to stay in session until an agreement is made but to keep lawmakers in Washington until a deal is struck if the caucus decided to do so according to a source familiar with the conversation. Hoyer for his part amplified his previous assertion that the House should vote on a new Democratic stimulus bill before the chamber adjourns at month’s end.Some Democrats downplayed any divisions in the party’s highest ranks.“Steny is not at odds with Pelosi” said Brown who spoke to Hoyer a fellow Maryland Democrat on the floor Tuesday. The two leaders merely differ “in the details” he added.

Conservatives see glaring omission on Trump's Supreme Court shortlist,headline,http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/516413-conservatives-see-glaring-omission-on-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist,thehill.com,1600223579509
President TrumpDonald John TrumpDemocrats advocates seethe over Florida voting rights ruling Russian jets identified in Trump campaign ad calling for support for the troops Democratic Senate candidate 'hesitant' to get COVID-19 vaccine if approved this year MORE’s Supreme Court shortlist released last week included a mix of controversial names and conservative favorites but his decision to leave off one particular judge was just as notable as any of the potential nominees.Judge Neomi Rao has been one the president’s most reliable allies on the federal bench since the Senate confirmed her in March 2019 on a party-line vote. During her time on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals — considered the second most important court in the country and a stepping stone for the Supreme Court — Rao has ruled in favor of former national security adviser Michael Flynn defended Trump against subpoenas for his personal records and approved the administration’s effort to resume federal executions for the first time in 17 years.But during her rocky confirmation process she faced tough questions from social conservatives about her stance on abortion an episode that likely led to her omission from last week’s shortlist according to a source close to the administration.Rao could not be reached for comment.Her exclusion from the list has drawn criticism from other conservatives particularly staunch free market supporters who went to bat for her last year during the confirmation process. It also highlights how even traditional conservative judges may be facing increased scrutiny for their stance on social issues like abortion after a Supreme Court term that featured a handful of surprising liberal victories despite a solid 5-4 conservative majority on the bench.Earlier this summer the court disappointed many conservatives with rulings that upheld Obama-era deportation protections solidified workplace rights for LGBT employees and struck down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law. In each of the decisions the four liberal justices were joined by at least one of their conservative colleagues.Trump responded to the defeats by vowing to release a shortlist of people he would consider for the high court if reelected to a second term mimicking a move he employed during the 2016 campaign to help win over religious conservatives.“These horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives” Trump tweeted in June. “We need more Justices or we will lose our 2nd. Amendment & everything else. Vote Trump 2020!”Many court watchers expected Rao to be on the most recent list given how she has sided with the administration and issued bold opinions during her tenure.But people familiar with the administration’s thinking indicated that Rao’s views on abortion were likely a major factor in why she was not among the 20 names on the list.“The conservative movement is going to be watching her D.C. Circuit decisions closely on this issue” one source close to the administration said.Rao has strong conservative bona fides.

But he also took a parting shot at right-wing legal activists whom he felt were taking social conservatives for granted.“I am committed to thoroughly vetting every judicial nominee who comes before the Senate Judiciary Committee especially appellate nominees” Hawley said in a statement at the time. “That means asking nominees tough questions about how they will interpret the Constitution how they think about precedent and how they view the role of a judge. That’s my job as a Senator. I won’t apologize for doing it. There are some in this town who say ‘trust us’ but past experience has shown that conservatives have been burned by that approach.”In June after the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 opinion authored by Justice Neil GorsuchNeil GorsuchCruz says he wouldn't accept Supreme Court nomination Trump's Supreme Court list reveals influence of Clarence Thomas Tom Cotton after Trump names him potential Supreme Court nominee: 'It's time for Roe v. Wade to go' MORE Trump’s first appointee to the court that LGBT workers are protected by existing workplace discrimination laws Hawley portrayed the decision as a betrayal to the GOP’s socially conservative wing that had helped it secure a Supreme Court majority for the first time in years.“It represents the end of the conservative legal movement or the conservative legal project as we know it” Hawley said of the decision on the Senate floor. “If we’ve been fighting for originalism and textualism and this is the result of that then I have to say that we haven’t been fighting for very much.”Hawley’s advocacy has opened a rift on the right with some of the conservative legal movement’s leaders criticizing his stance on judicial nominees. When the Missouri senator publicly criticized Rao in February 2019 Carrie Severino president of the Judicial Crisis Network blasted him in a statement to Axios.“Instead of supporting President Trump’s top judicial nominee he is spreading the very same kind of rumors and innuendo and character assassination that Republican leaders fought during Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation” Severino said. “Hawley could be working to confirm her and other extraordinary nominees but it seems he’d rather be making headlines.”Severino declined to comment for this story.The fact that Trump included Hawley on his shortlist but left out Rao did not go unnoticed by her supporters as well as multiple conservatives close to the administration who said they viewed it as a slight against the judge.Ashley Baker policy director for the conservative group Committee for Justice criticized the decision to leave Rao off the list and include Hawley. Baker told The Hill that she believes the senator’s proposed benchmark on abortion for conservative judges will not be an effective metric for evaluating nominees.“Senator Hawley has proposed a sort of ‘litmus test’ for being on the record as pro-life” she said in an email. “While there are debatably some larger problems with this form of results-oriented jurisprudence the fundamental flaw with this proposal is that the test wouldn’t work.”Baker went on to say that Hawley’s approach would still have led to confirmation of former Justices Anthony Kennedy Sandra Day O’Connor and David Souter who were all appointed by Republican presidents but ended up becoming swing votes on many social issues.While Hawley’s inclusion on the list may have irked some on the right he quickly disavowed any interest in serving on the bench.“I appreciate the President’s confidence in listing me as a potential Supreme Court nominee” Hawley tweeted last week. “But as I told the President Missourians elected me to fight for them in the Senate and I have no interest in the high court. I look forward to confirming constitutional conservatives.”Brett Samuels contributed.,body,http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/516413-conservatives-see-glaring-omission-on-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist,thehill.com,1600223579509

How does every Joe BidenJoe BidenDemocrats advocates seethe over Florida voting rights ruling Trump order on drug prices faces long road to finish line There's no debate: America needs an equitable and resilient government MORE campaign staff meeting start? I imagine everyone takes a solemn oath not to blow the election. And so far it’s working. If Biden has made any mistakes it has been leaving his basement too often.Facing any candidate or incumbent other than President TrumpDonald John TrumpDemocrats advocates seethe over Florida voting rights ruling Russian jets identified in Trump campaign ad calling for support for the troops Democratic Senate candidate 'hesitant' to get COVID-19 vaccine if approved this year MORE running out the clock would be a highly risky strategy — but Trump keeps sabotaging his own momentum and has shown no aptitude for self-discipline.Even more important the national mood which benefited Trump in 2016 is a drag on his prospects in 2020. The simple rule of thumb for campaigns is that undecideds go for challengers. After all the incumbent is a known commodity and re-elections are mostly referenda on the incumbent. Essentially if a given voter hasn’t decided for the incumbent as Election Day approaches the voter will either vote against the incumbent or not vote. That is bad news for Trump who lags in national and swing state polls.The key 2016 polling statistic was the “right track/wrong track” number. In 2016 63 percent thought the country was on the “wrong track.” It should have been no surprise that undecided voters would gravitate to Trump — the de facto challenger. In 2020 the right track/wrong track number is 62 percent wrong track 26 percent right track. Simply put we should expect the “wrong track” voters to move to Biden the non-incumbent.The election is coming down to Arizona Florida Michigan Minnesota North Carolina Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Ohio could flip to Biden but then it’s a rout. Limited polling also shows Nevada’s 6 votes competitive but they are unlikely to make a difference.According to the RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight state polling averages Biden leads Trump in every swing state. If so Biden would win 333 electoral votes to 205. But that is if the polling averages are right and the undecideds split proportionately. If the Trump vote is underestimated how would the election project?The FiveThirtyEight site runs multiple projections to obtain a series of predictive results. The level of complexity is interesting but not really necessary (and introduces its own errors and biases). Taking the current polling three simple projections can be made: best case for Biden; best case for Trump and a middle case.In the best case for Biden the polls are accurate (nobody has posited the existence of “hidden” Biden voters) and the undecideds break along the right track/wrong track lines: 62 percent for Biden and 38 percent for Trump. This split puts every swing state and Ohio in the Biden column and a 351-187 electoral victory. In the middle case Trump’s “hidden” vote is 2 percent. RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight averages disagree on Florida and North Carolina but do keep Ohio in the Trump column. Still a loss for Trump.The best case for Trump assumes 3 percent of voters are secret Trump supporters. Assuming that such voters are declaring as “undecided” and not flat out lying and splitting the remaining undecideds along the right track/wrong track number Trump holds North Carolina and Ohio. Florida would stay with Trump according to the RealClearPolitics average but flip to Biden under the FiveThirtyEight average. Biden would still win 289-249.If we drop the averages and instead look at the most recent state polling by Morning Consult (Sept. 9) Trump is still in trouble. Only Ohio would stay with Trump under any of the three above scenarios and possibly Arizona if the large recent swing to Biden is overstated. Even a best case across the board has Trump losing.Could Trump still turn things around?Theoretically but the underlying numbers are daunting.Voters have consistently shown limited confidence in Biden. Whether handling the coronavirus (33 percent) or dealing with civil unrest (32 percent) Biden is behind with independent voters. But Trump polls even worse on all these dimensions — and the problem for him is that he’s president. Only on the economy does Trump poll better but just barely.As president Trump is expected to solve problems or present a path forward for solutions. Instead Trump just rages and attacks. There is no affirmative plan. As long as Trump presents no action plan or shows any ability to end the chaos the average voter is more likely to take a flyer on the challenger.Trump’s message is that things will only get worse with Biden. That may be true but that message is a tacit admission that things are bad now and he has no fixes.Trump’s “Make America Great Again” was one of the great slogans in campaign history — it was an optimistic message about America and an attack message implying that the country was in trouble. The amount of lampooning it was subject to was just a testament to its power.What’s Trump’s slogan now? He doesn’t have one. He has no optimistic message and as incumbent he owns the chaos.Biden is winning by letting Trump lose.A more disciplined skilled politician would be taking advantage of the overreach and violence of the protesters and the improving situation regarding the coronavirus. A president like Reagan or Nixon would have made a national address (or multiple addresses) with a plan of action and would have kept himself and his entire administration on message.When times were good Trump benefited from being non-traditional and extemporaneous. But now his undisciplined frenetic style is a huge liability and has put a ceiling on his vote.Trump can rage all he wants at Biden and the media but losing will be his responsibility alone.Keith Naughton Ph.D. co-founder of Silent Majority Strategies is a public affairs consultant who specialized in Pennsylvania judicial elections.

Of course many women choose to undergo sterilization themselves (often though this is done through tubal ligation rather than a hysterectomy). But as Judge Gerhard Gesell concluded in the 1973 landmark case Relf v. Weinberger which required doctors to obtain informed consent before sterilizing someone in the United States “the dividing line between family planning and eugenics is murky.” The case was filed on behalf of sisters Minnie and Mary Alice Relf who were 12 and 14 respectively when their illiterate mother unwittingly gave their doctor consent to sterilize them. After the sisters held a news conference thousands of Black and native women came forward to report their own coercive sterilizations. Gesell estimated that in just a few years 100000 to 150000 poor women had been sterilized under federal programs and an indefinite number had been coerced to do so at the threat of losing their welfare benefits.,body,http://www.thelily.com/a-whistleblower-alleges-mass-hysterectomies-at-an-ice-detention-center-the-us-has-a-brutal-history-of-forced-sterilizations/?tid=wp_hp_lily_rr,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Sonoma’s vaunted wineries embrace online sales, budget pricing to woo pandemic drinkers,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/road-to-recovery/supply-chain-wine/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
In Sonoma Valley home to 60000 acres of grapes and 400 wineries the pandemic has crushed the local business model and disrupted an 150-year-old supply chain.Grape growers that once focused on selling to high-end wineries are lowering their prices and supplying cheaper brands. Wineries that can no longer count on tourist visits are replacing in-person events with online campaigns. Restaurants that boasted of expansive wine lists now tout their to-go cups.The industry is “doing whatever [it] can over the last five months to really look at and examine their business model to figure out how they can sustain themselves” said Maureen Cottingham executive director of the Sonoma Valley Vintners and Growers Alliance. “Of course there are some businesses that will not be able to sustain themselves and unfortunately that will close.”It’s the biggest challenge to Sonoma Valley since three wildfires in 2017 destroyed thousands of acres in the region and comes as devastating fires are once again raging across California. To recover this time the industry says it must adopt the types of changes that have been long resisted and find a new path.Here are the stories of four companies along a single supply chain in Sonoma Valley.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/road-to-recovery/supply-chain-wine/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Judy Shelton doesn’t have the votes for confirmation to Federal Reserve, leading Senate Republican says,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/judy-shelton-fed/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Talking to reporters Thune also said that conversations around Shelton’s nomination “kind of got eclipsed by the coronavirus discussion” as Congress squabbled over another stimulus package. Thune said focus had shifted back to Shelton’s nomination and “discussing it with some of our members who had some questions.”“We’re still having some discussions and you know when it’s when it’s ripe we’ll move” Thune said.In a statement White House spokesman Judd Deere said that “President Trump is firmly behind his nomination of Judy Shelton who is exceptionally qualified to the Federal Reserve. Senate Democrats should stop playing politics and confirm the President’s nominee.”Shelton who advised Trump’s 2016 presidential run has had a contentious nomination process from the start. In July Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she would vote against her nomination joining Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah). If all Senate Democrats and independents voted against the nomination Shelton’s confirmation would be doomed if she lost the support of four Republicans.Shelton narrowly made it through the Senate Banking Committee this summer after a 13-to-12 vote along party lines. Earlier in the year some Republicans on the panel expressed concerns about Shelton’s views on the Fed’s independence and monetary policy.In past remarks and writings Shelton has said the Fed harnesses too much power and should be reined in. She has also called for a return to the long-abandoned gold standard and her critics say her views make her too much of an outlier.A spokeswoman for the Senate Banking Committee declined to comment.Typically the process for confirming Fed governors does not hinge so narrowly on a few votes or fan political flames. Senate Democrats also argue that the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing recession raise doubts about Shelton’s fitness to join the board that influences U.S. monetary policy.“This isn’t a partisan issue — her economic ideas wouldn’t give families and businesses the steady hand they need in this crisis” tweeted Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) the top Democrat on the banking panel.George Selgin director of the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives said that based on Thune’s comments Shelton’s candidacy hasn’t been definitively ruled out and it isn’t entirely clear which other Senate Republicans wouldn’t vote to confirm her.Rather Selgin said that Thune’s remarks underscore a broader message about politics and the administration. “There are always people who in principle could still be on the fence but they’re sending a strong signal that it’s going to be a real uphill battle at this point” Selgin said. “It isn’t quite over but it’s a strong signal that it’s going to be a knockdown drag-down fight and that the costs to the Republicans would be very high without any guarantee of prevailing.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/judy-shelton-fed/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Washington Capitals hire Peter Laviolette as team’s new coach,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/peter-laviolette-hired-washington-capitals/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Laviolette who will join Washington on a three-year deal has 18 years of NHL head coaching experience with the New York Islanders Carolina Hurricanes Philadelphia Flyers and Nashville Predators. He has led three teams to the Stanley Cup finals — the Predators in 2017 Flyers in 2010 and Hurricanes in 2006 — and won the Cup with Carolina.“Peter has a track record of establishing a culture and it’s one of his priorities” Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan said during an online news conference Tuesday. “And part of that culture is getting guys to play the right way and holding them accountable to play the right way. I think it’s a big priority when you talk to him so I have confidence because he’s done it in the past and it’s a priority the way he speaks about it the way he communicates about it.” When MacLellan described what the organization wanted in its next coach on the day of Reirden’s firing the word he emphasized was “experience.” The Capitals needed a veteran coach who could get immediate results from a veteran group. Laviolette MacLellan reiterated Tuesday exemplifies just that.Laviolette became the first coach in franchise history to arrive in Washington with a Stanley Cup on his résumé.“I look at it as a great opportunity” Laviolette said of coming to Washington. “You have a terrific cast of talent that’s big and strong and can play the game aggressive and has a chance to be successful on a nightly basis. For me it’s an incredible opportunity. I can’t speak from experience working with this group because I haven’t been there yet obviously. But I am excited to get in there and start to work with them and build something special.”The organization wanted — and needed — a coach who can push the players hold them accountable when they aren’t at their best and reset the team’s culture. Laviolette now with his fifth NHL organization as coach will have his shot with an aging core that isn’t getting younger.Laviolette said he has yet to speak to Alex Ovechkin but is looking forward to coaching the captain and the rest of the veteran group. He said he still needed to reach out to staffers and coaches before making any decisions about assistant coaching changes.Washington which won the Stanley Cup in 2018 was searching for a coach who could get the most out of the team now. Laviolette has been known to find success early in his coaching tenures which matches up with Washington’s needs. “I see a team that’s had success recently regular season success some postseason success and for me that’s the great opportunity” Laviolette said. “I don’t necessarily look at it and say ‘Well it’s got to happen this year or it’ll never happen.’ I’m excited to go in and be here and be a part of this and add any layer that I can as a coach to try and help (us) get to that next step.“So it’s kind of a difficult question for me. If you’re asking me ‘What do I see?’ I don’t look at it that way and say ‘Well it’s next year or nothing.’ I look at it and say ‘This is just a great opportunity and I can’t wait to get started.’ ”In his first full year with Carolina he led the Hurricanes to a Stanley Cup beating the Edmonton Oilers in the finals in seven games.Laviolette was fired by the Predators in January after a disappointing first half of the season. He had been Nashville’s coach since 2014-15 season and compiled a 248-143-60 record with the team which included a run to the 2017 Stanley Cup finals. He also led the Predators to the Presidents’ Trophy in 2017-18“The freshness of coming into a team that I haven’t been in before always excites me just because it’s not only new to them but it’s new for me as well and it’s a chance for really a group to start on Page One on Day One and to build something that could be really really good” Laviolette said.The Capitals also interviewed Mike Babcock and Gerard Gallant for the job. Bruce Boudreau Washington’s former coach was also linked to conversations about the opening.Babcock was fired by the Toronto Maple Leafs in late November and soon after reports surfaced that accused him of mistreating players and using psychological intimidation as a motivating tactic concerns that would need to be addressed if he returned to the NHL. Babcock was Detroit’s coach when the Red Wings won a Stanley Cup in 2008 and was the coach of Team Canada when it won gold at the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics.Gallant led the Vegas Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup finals in their inaugural season when they lost to the Capitals in 2018. Gallant who is considered a players’ coach was fired in January after only 2½ seasons at the helm.“To be a coach and to be able to be on the inside and be a part of that and watch something like that happen that’s what coaching is all about for me” Laviolette said. “So coming to Washington that’s my priority is to try and build something where when the players take the ice they truly feel like they’re invincible.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/peter-laviolette-hired-washington-capitals/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Fear in Northern Ireland, as Boris Johnson threatens the E.U. over Brexit,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/brexit-northern-ireland/2020/09/15/05a90dcc-f6a8-11ea-85f7-5941188a98cd_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Britain will leave the European Union at the end of 2020 with or without a new free-trade deal Johnson promises. With just over three months to go before the end of a transition period a pact between the sides seems as far away as ever. Relations between Europe and Britain have grown shouty underlining the high stakes of the showdown as Britain and Europe both struggle to recover from deep pandemic recessions.Rachel Powell grew up in South Armagh where during the Troubles a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was patrolled by British troops often attacked by Irish republican militants. She said she’s deeply concerned about what will happen next.“The British government has not got a clue about what it is like to live on the border and it is again using it as a political football” said Powell a lobbyist with the Women’s Resource and Development Agency in Belfast.The 1998 Good Friday Agreement brought peace to Ireland — and today the line marking the boundary between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is invisible.Powell said border communities are “horrified” over the uncertainties and brinkmanship of Brexit.In the past week Johnson started to deploy martial language asserting that the E.U. is plotting to “carve up our country” and to choke off food supplies with destabilizing new barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.“Unless we agree to the E.U.’s terms the E.U. will use an extreme interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol to impose a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea” Johnson wrote in the Telegraph newspaper.Irish Foreign Affairs Secretary Simon Coveney dismissed Johnson’s claim that Europe wanted to “blockade” Northern Ireland as “totally bogus.”Europeans are livid that Johnson has introduced a bill before Parliament that would breach key parts of the Brexit withdrawal treaty an agreement Johnson signed only nine months ago calling the pact “historic” and “fantastic.”The deal seeks to finesse trade and customs issues to enable Northern Ireland to exit along with the rest of the United Kingdom but to preserve easy trade — and psychological ties — with the Republic of Ireland which will remain part of the E.U. In the absence of a free-trade deal there would probably have to be some kind of controls between north and south to levy tariffs and quotas.Chief E.U. negotiator Michel Barnier said the Northern Ireland protocol signed last year represents no threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom. He tweeted “We agreed this delicate compromise with [Boris Johnson] & his gov in order to protect peace & stability on island of Ireland. We could not have been clearer about the consequences of #Brexit.”Martin O’Brien is a veteran peace-building activist from north Belfast who worked to ensure that strong human rights were included in the Good Friday Agreement. “Brexit — and this government’s particular form of Brexit a hard Brexit — was embarked on with no regard to the consequences for Northern Ireland” he said.O’Brien called the withdrawal agreement signed by the U.K. and E.U. last year “a carefully constructed mechanism to try to minimize the worst consequences” of Brexit.“Now the government has decided to go back on the compromise and again that is hugely destabilizing” he said.Queen’s University Belfast professor Katy Hayward said “We should be familiar with this by now the stirring up of a political storm over Northern Ireland and its place after Brexit but we are no less weary of it.”She said that “the anxieties are only growing. . . . We face the prospect of the U.K. flagrantly breaking international law and using Northern Ireland’s position as justification for it. This sets a whole new precedent. And it bodes very badly for peace.”During the Troubles more than 3500 people were killed over half of them civilians.Brandon Lewis Johnson’s minister for Northern Ireland admitted to the House of Commons last week that the new bill to amend the Brexit deal with Europe will “break international law” but he said only in a “specific and limited way.”Johnson’s move has set off alarms in the U.S. Congress with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) warning that today’s open border between north and south must be preserved at all costs. Undermine the Good Friday pact Pelosi said and “there will be absolutely no chance of a U.S.-U.K. trade agreement passing the Congress.”If Britain and Europe are unable to sign a trade deal by year’s end then World Trade Organization rules would apply to goods traded between the E.U. and the U.K. with tariffs and quotas levied in both directions. Supply chains 40 years in the making could be derailed.On the island of Ireland there is growing anxiety that Johnson is hurtling toward a no-deal Brexit.“Securing a ‘zero tariff zero quota’ free-trade agreement with the E.U. remains critical to the future of U.K. businesses” said Ann McGregor chief executive of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “We urge ministers to redouble their efforts to reach a comprehensive agreement with our largest trading partner at a crucial time in the negotiations.”Former British prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major joined forces to condemn Johnson’s attempt to override the ­Brexit agreement calling it “shameful.” They urged lawmakers in the Labour and Conservative parties to vote down the bill.“It raises questions that go far beyond the impact on Ireland the peace process and negotiations for a trade deal — crucial though they are. It questions the very integrity of our nation” the pair wrote in the Sunday Times.Since then the bill cleared an initial vote in the House of Commons.Sammy Wilson a senior figure in the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland said his group will table amendments to Johnson’s bill. But he dismissed as “utter bunkum” the former prime ministers’ worry that the Irish peace could unravel.Wilson said Johnson’s bill will make it easier for Northern Ireland to do business with Great Britain with less paperwork.Booth reported from London.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/brexit-northern-ireland/2020/09/15/05a90dcc-f6a8-11ea-85f7-5941188a98cd_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Deadly force behind the wheel,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/investigations/pit-maneuver-police-deaths/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Editor’s note: The videos in this story contain graphic content. Shortly before midnight on March 28 2017 a silver Dodge Caravan streaked past Highway Patrol Trooper Dustin A. Motsinger as he sat parked along a stretch of highway in rural North Carolina. Motsinger raced after the speeding van. The driver stopped but as the trooper climbed out of his cruiser the van drove off. Motsinger gave chase. Inside the van that night 15-year-old Osiel Carbajal was at the wheel. His passengers: his 16-year-old sister her 15-year-old boyfriend and a 15-year-old friend. The teens had taken the van without permission from Carbajal’s mother in nearby Morven. “Possibly 55 they’re all over the place” Motsinger told his supervisor on the radio using the code for a drunk driver. “If you can PIT him go ahead” said the supervisor. As the teens crossed the Anson County line at 100 mph Motsinger caught up with them. Then he bumped his Dodge Charger into the right rear quarter panel of the Caravan sending it off the road. The van flipped and began to cartwheel landing almost 500 feet away. The force sheared the wheels from the left side of the vehicle. The impact hurled three of the teens from the Caravan. Two of them died. One broke his back. The driver suffered minor injuries. A minivan crashed after a high-speed chase with a North Carolina Highway Patrol trooper in 2017. The trooper performed a PIT maneuver causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle which flipped over and landed 500 feet away killing two passengers. (North Carolina State Highway Patrol Collision Reconstruction Unit) The trooper’s maneuver was no accident — it was a PIT or precision immobilization technique a tactical driving maneuver for which he’d been trained. In a successful PIT the pursuing officer uses the cruiser to push the fleeing vehicle’s rear end sideways sending it into a spin and ending the pursuit. But the tactic can have deadly consequences. So far this year nine people have been killed nationwide in PIT maneuvers including a 16-year-old who was driving a stolen car in Longmont Colo. and a driver and passenger who were being chased by police for speeding in Creek County Okla. Just this month a 29-year-old suspected drunk driver who fled a traffic stop in Coweta County Ga. died after a PIT maneuver. Since 2016 at least 30 people have died and hundreds have been injured — including some officers — when police used the maneuver to end pursuits according to an investigation by The Washington Post. Out of those deaths 18 came after officers attempted to stop vehicles for minor traffic violations such as speeding. In eight cases police were pursuing a stolen car and in two drivers were suspected of serious felonies. Two other drivers had been reported as suicidal. Ten of the 30 killed were passengers in the fleeing vehicles; four were bystanders or the victim of a crime. Half of those who died in the crashes were people of color: nine Black four Hispanic and one Native American. Fourteen of those killed were White and the race of two could not be determined. The total number of people who have been killed or injured as a result of the maneuver is unknown because the nation’s more than 18000 police departments are not required by the federal government to keep track. The death on May 25 of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer has led to renewed public scrutiny of violent police tactics including shootings stun guns and chokeholds. But the PIT maneuver — also a potentially deadly use of force by police — has not received the same attention despite its risk and widespread adoption by departments nationwide. To study the tactic The Post gathered statistics about PIT deaths and injuries since 2016 from news reports and records from the 100 largest city police departments and 49 state police agencies. Responses were received from 142 of them. Most departments do not break out deaths and injuries and were able to provide only policies on whether they used the maneuver. Many were unable to say how often chases ended in PITs. One of the nine drivers killed this year was 34-year-old Justin Battenfield a man whose family said he was mentally disabled and loved to drive the roads around his home in Van Buren Ark. Shortly after dawn on April 10 Battenfield in a Dodge Ram failed to stop at a traffic signal and then began to flee when a U.S. Forest Service officer attempted to stop him. Arkansas State Trooper Michael Shawn Ellis picked up the pursuit. Dashboard-camera video from the trooper’s car captured Battenfield as he swerved into the path of oncoming traffic. “Get this car stopped as soon as there’s an opening” a supervisor told Ellis over the radio. Ellis hit Battenfield’s truck at 109 mph sending both vehicles into a tumble. Battenfield’s truck landed on its roof and acted as a ramp for the trooper’s car launching it into the air where it sliced through two street lamps. Arkansas State Police performed a PIT maneuver at 109 mph to end a chase in Fort Smith Ark. on April 10 2020. The chase began after Justin Battenfield failed to stop at a traffic signal. Battenfield died and the officer was injured. Battenfield died and Ellis suffered “non-life-threatening injuries” according to state police. “They should have backed off and he would have come on home” said Carol Henson Battenfield’s mother. “Then they could have come up and got him.” An Arkansas State Patrol spokesman said the department regretted the loss of life but he emphasized that the PIT often hinges on the unpredictable behavior of the fleeing driver. “The PIT . . . is supposed to be a controlled maneuver based on all of the factors at that second the law enforcement officer’s bumper makes contact with the vehicle. That’s what everything is based on. If the suspect changes the dynamics in any way it could very easily turn bad and no question about it” spokesman Bill Sadler said. He declined to make Ellis available for comment. When performed at slower speeds — generally 35 to 45 mph — the maneuver can be safe and effective to end pursuits experts said. The Los Angeles Police Department reports that it has used PIT maneuvers since 2005 without a death or serious injury. The department does not permit the maneuver at over 35 mph. Officers are not allowed to chase or PIT vehicles that are fleeing minor traffic violations. And its use is limited to pursuits involving dangerous felons or drunk drivers. “It allows us to safeguard the surrounding community while capturing an offender who has committed a serious offense” Los Angeles Police Chief Michel R. Moore said. He described it as an important tool in specific circumstances. “We recognize that over that speed the dynamic nature and the physics of an engagement can result in a vehicle that becomes a risk to the public the occupants and the officers” Moore said. How police use a PIT maneuver to end a pursuit First the officer pulls alongside the fleeing vehicle and matches its speed. Using the front quarter panel the officer makes contact with and gently steers into the rear quarter panel of the fleeing vehicle. The target vehicle spins in the opposite direction of the officer's turn. The police car continues to move forward. The target vehicle spins out and comes to a stop. The police car continues forward until clear of the target. At greater speeds the maneuver has launched cars into traffic and trees and in one case killed a woman in Tift County Ga. as she stood in her front yard. “When you start getting into high speeds it gets very dangerous” said Rick Giovengo who has studied the use of the PIT as a senior research analyst at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers in Glynco Ga. where federal state local and tribal officers from across the country train to use the PIT. Despite the risk there has been little national research on its safety or benefits. In 2006 the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police conducted one of the few studies of the maneuver as part of a wider look at police pursuits in the state. The report concluded that “the PIT maneuver is controlled and predictable” but “in certain circumstances could result in serious injury or death.” Those circumstances the report said included a PIT on a driver who is not wearing a seat belt a PIT that ejected people from the fleeing vehicle or a PIT that knocked the fleeing car into a roll. The Police Executive Research Forum a Washington-based think tank that advises police chiefs on policy has examined the lethal use of firearms and police pursuits but not the use of the PIT. “We generally don’t recommend it” said Chuck Wexler executive director of the group. “You wouldn’t want to endanger the officer or the person you’re pursuing unless you had some reason to believe they were going to commit a violent crime.” Karen M. Blum a law professor at Suffolk University Law School studied the tactic for the National Police Accountability Project which filed a brief in a Supreme Court case brought by a man who was paralyzed in 2001 during an attempted PIT by a Georgia police officer. “Over a certain speed there is nothing precise about a PIT maneuver” Blum said. “It amounts to a ramming that turns two heavy vehicles into deadly projectiles.” A Pickens County Sheriff’s Office deputy performed a PIT maneuver in Jasper Ga. on Jan. 29 2019. The deputy was attempting to stop the driver for an outstanding felony warrant. (Pickens County Sheriff’s Office) Bystanders pay a price Last year the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office in Florida engaged in more than 200 police pursuits ending 61 of them with PITs according to an annual report from the office. Only one of those ended in a death: Louis Warren Reese an 84-year-old retired Navy veteran who had been kidnapped. Shortly after 2 p.m. on Jan. 2 2019 a gunman robbed the Lucky Charms Arcade in Jacksonville and fled on foot into Reese’s backyard. Police surrounded ­Reese’s property. The suspected gunman Lawrence Hall III broke into Reese’s house shoved him into the back of his Dodge SUV parked in the garage opened the door and sped away. As a police helicopter and patrol cars followed the fleeing SUV police searched for Reese — unaware that he was in the back of the SUV according to police reports. During the chase — which reached speeds in excess of 100 mph — Hall drove into an officer attempting to place tire deflation sticks in the road. Another officer attempted to PIT the SUV but failed and crashed. Finally eight miles from where it began a K-9 officer performed a PIT on the fleeing vehicle according to police reports. The PIT sent the SUV into a cement telephone pole and the car split in two. Power lines fell onto its roof and the car began to burn. Police rescued Hall — and then realized Reese also was in the car. “The responding officers extinguished the fire and it was at this time they discovered an elderly male . . . in the back seat of the vehicle” officers wrote in a report. Reese a deacon at his church suffered a collapsed lung and fractures including a broken leg arm and spine his family told a local television station. He died in a hospital a week later. His family did not respond to requests for comment. Hall and two deputies suffered serious injuries. The deputies were awarded Purple Heart medals and Hall was charged with attempted murder and kidnapping. The case is pending. The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office declined to comment on the crash or the use of the maneuver citing an ongoing investigation into the crimes. Throughout the 1990s only a few departments nationwide embraced the tactic which is known by various names including tactical vehicle intervention or TVI. In 1996 a Tampa police sergeant on a search for new tactics to safely end pursuits learned of its use by police in Fairfax County Va. “I can teach a chimpanzee how to do this” he later told the Tampa Bay Times. Other departments began using the PIT including the Georgia State Patrol. Since 1997 the patrol has performed more than 1500 PIT maneuvers according to court and agency records logging the first fatality in 1998. Since then at least 34 people have been killed including seven since 2016. “When it’s utilized within policy and within state law we feel we’re doing a good job and that there are no reservations” said Lt. Stephanie Stallings a Georgia State Patrol spokeswoman. “Certainly we would never want a death to occur from any maneuver that we utilize but unfortunately there are cases when death is a result.” A deputy in Georgia used the PIT maneuver at 77 mph to stop a driver in Lawrenceville Ga. on Oct. 17 2017. The chase which reached speeds in excess of 100 mph started after the car changed lanes abruptly. Two children were in the vehicle and the mother was charged with driving under the influence. (Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Department) Other departments across the state have adopted the PIT maneuver — in some cases leading to disastrous outcomes. In September a Whitfield County Ga. deputy used a PIT to end his pursuit of a stolen car. The 21-year-old driver Makayla Whitt was ejected and thrown 50 feet and her left arm was severed below the elbow according to police reports. Whitt could not be reached for comment. In June 2018 in Monroe County Ga. a sheriff’s deputy pulled over 28-year-old Guadalupe Garcia because of a suspected window-tinting violation according to local news reports. Garcia fled and the deputy performed a PIT at nearly 76 mph knocking his Toyota Camry into trees throwing Garcia and his 19-year-old nephew from the car. Garcia died and his nephew told The Post he was hospitalized for at least two weeks. The Monroe County Sheriff’s Department did not respond to requests for comment. Priscilla Villaneueva Garcia’s girlfriend and the mother of their three children told The Post that he had been in trouble with police and was afraid of being deported. He had been arrested before on drug charges. “I think they should have tried another method of slowing the car down” Villaneueva said. “The PIT was done at such a high speed.” Outside Atlanta on Dec. 4 2018 South Fulton police attempted to pull over a Hyundai Sonata that had been reported stolen. The driver 19-year-old Emmitt Daniels sped off nearly striking an officer who had just exited his police vehicle. Officers gave chase pursuing Daniels for about three miles and reaching speeds of at least 65 mph according to police reports. A wrecked Hyundai Sonata sits by the side of the road in South Fulton Ga. after a crash on Dec. 4 2018. According to police reports the crash followed a police chase that reached speeds of at least 65 mph and ended when an officer performed a PIT sending the Hyundai spinning across a sidewalk killing a pedestrian. (Georgia Department of Public Safety) As Daniels passed a cluster of townhouses one of the officers performed a PIT maneuver using his Dodge Charger to strike the right rear corner of the Hyundai sending it spinning across a sidewalk. The car splintered a utility pole and rolled up a steep embankment coming to a stop. Daniels sprinted into the townhouses escaping police. As police investigated they found a shoe near the scene of the crash which they suspected Daniels lost while fleeing according to a local news report. Five weeks later a landscaper working in the area found the body of 41-year-old Marcus McCrary who had been struck and killed by the out-of-control Hyundai. McCrary’s body which was found hidden behind bushes was missing its lower left leg the landscaper told The Post. Police later found the lower part of McCrary’s leg in a wheel well of the Hyundai in an impound lot. McCrary’s twin sister Miracle Walker said that the day of the crash McCrary was on the way to her house only a few blocks away. When he didn’t show up she tried to find him but had no luck. She said she now knows the exact moment her brother died: The lights in her house went out when Daniels’s vehicle knocked over the power lines. “The officers said speeds were up to 90 miles an hour” Walker told The Post saying that both the police and Daniels are to blame. “There’s not any given time you can go down that street and there aren’t pedestrians.” Daniels was arrested a few weeks later on charges of felony murder and homicide by vehicle in the death of McCrary according to court documents. The case is ongoing. An attorney for Daniels did not respond to a request for comment. South Fulton Police Chief Keith Meadows also did not respond to requests for comment. A driver survived after she was ejected from a vehicle following a PIT maneuver by deputies in Florence S.C. on July 12 2018. The deputies had tried to stop the woman’s vehicle for a traffic violation. (Florence County Sheriff’s Office) ‘We don’t want to take the chance’ The risks of using the PIT have divided departments. Of the 142 law enforcement agencies that responded to The Post 74 said they do not use the maneuver. One would not say. “We do not use the PIT maneuver and the reason is safety” said Paul Linders a spokesman for the St. Paul Police Department in Minnesota. “If our officers were to PIT a vehicle in a residential area the vehicle could wind up in a yard playground or storefront. We don’t want to take the chance of injuring an innocent bystander to end a pursuit that way.” The New York State Police does not use the tactic “due to the potential danger it poses for the targeted vehicle occupants the pursuing Troopers and the motoring public” according to Beau Duffy a spokesman for the department. The Fairfax County Police Department one of the first to embrace the maneuver said it has trained many agencies across the country to use it. “We can do a PIT with minimal damage or no damage besides paint transfer between two vehicles and get the car to stop where we want it to stop” said 2nd Lt. Jay Jackson who is in charge of the center and track in Chantilly Va. where Fairfax police conduct pursuit training. Officers gradually learn how to match the speed of a fleeing vehicle and make contact with the vehicle in motion Jackson said. Officers cannot use the tactic on the streets until they have completed eight successful PITs on the track. They are required to recertify every three years. Jackson said that at 45 mph and below the fleeing cars will spin 180 degrees into the next lane. Above that speed events are less predictable he said. Deputies in Cumming Ga. tried repeatedly to use the PIT maneuver to end a high-speed chase on April 4 2018. After the crash a group of young people fled the vehicle. Three were later arrested and charged in two burglaries. (Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office) Thirty of the 67 agencies that use the PIT maneuver allow their officers to do so at any speed; 26 of the agencies have a speed restriction according to The Post surveys. Eleven agencies provided no information about whether they have speed restrictions. The Indiana State Police for example prohibits its use at more than 50 mph. State police in Iowa and California limit the PIT to speeds of 35 mph and under. Many agencies suggest that officers receive approval from a supervisor before performing a PIT. The Utah Highway Patrol has a one-paragraph policy that requires officers who use the PIT to “act within the bounds of legality good judgment and accepted practices.” The Georgia State Patrol’s pursuit policy states that the officer should consider the condition of the road visibility pedestrian and vehicle traffic the type of vehicle and whether there are passengers in the fleeing vehicle. The patrol prohibits PITs on motorcycles or ATVs. But there is no limit on speed deferring to officers to decide what is “reasonable.” The Nebraska State Patrol warns against the use of PITs on pickup trucks with passengers in the cargo area or larger vehicles but has no limits on speed. Some agencies allow officers to perform PITs over specified speeds only if they believe use of deadly force is justified. “Some places and legal experts will say a PIT over 55 mph constitutes the use of deadly force and some will say 45. It’s somewhat arbitrary” said Geoffrey Alpert a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of South Carolina and co-author of “Evaluating Police Uses of Force.” In Albuquerque police allow officers to PIT vehicles at speeds greater than 35 mph when they believe deadly force is warranted. That was the case when police used the maneuver on a Gulf Stream Touring RV. Shortly after 7 p.m. on June 20 2017 police tried to arrest David Barber at an RV park on illegal gun possession and battery charges. Barber fled in a stolen 26-foot RV ripping the sewer hose and electrical cords from their connections and driving through a metal gate. At first police decided not to chase Barber because a police plane was monitoring the RV from above Sgt. Albert Sandoval said later in a deposition. But when Barber nearly hit an officer Sandoval ordered police to give chase. For about 45 minutes and at speeds of up to 70 mph police chased the RV which struck at least five vehicles. After the RV drove through a busy intersection an officer pulled alongside it and touched the front right side of his Ford Expedition to the rear driver’s side of the RV. He turned his steering wheel to the right. “The RV did not ‘spin out’ as he expected it would” according to a later investigation by police. Instead “the size and weight of the RV forced him and the RV across the median and into the southbound lanes of traffic.” The officer’s Expedition collided with three other cars but Barber kept going driving the RV over the median and back into the northbound traffic lanes. Another officer conducted a second PIT on the RV at about 62 mph records show. This time the PIT forced the RV to jump the center median and strike an oncoming Chevy Malibu. Driving the Malibu was Tito Pacheco a single father of three teenagers. Pacheco died three weeks later from his injuries. His children and brother sued the Albuquerque police settling for $500000 according to a city spokesperson. Pacheco’s family did not respond to a request for comment. Barber was arrested and charged with multiple crimes including first-degree murder in Pacheco’s death. The case is ongoing. “If we didn’t do anything to stop him at that time in that RV the chances of him killing somebody were very high” Sandoval said in a deposition for the lawsuit describing his order to stop the RV. “Once I gave that directive . . . I knew that these officers were going to utilize their vehicles to strike that vehicle which could cause death or great bodily harm to the driver” he said. Gilbert Gallegos an Albuquerque police spokesman said there have been many policy changes at the department since the crash. “I’m not aware of any other major incident dealing with PIT maneuvers” Gallegos said. “We also have additional driver training for officers involved in crashes and we recently got a new driving simulator to help with training.” An aerial view of the minivan that crashed after a high-speed chase with a North Carolina Highway Patrol trooper in 2017. The trooper performed a PIT maneuver that caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle killing two passengers. (North Carolina State Highway Patrol Collision Reconstruction Unit) ‘I saw at least one other occupant’ In the weeks before Motsinger the North Carolina Highway Patrol trooper used a PIT to stop the minivan full of teens he had ended two other pursuits with the tactic. In one he sent a driver into a ditch at 65 mph and caused $3300 in damage to his patrol car. He was driving a loaner vehicle the night he rammed the van records show. The teens were on the road that night because Maria Carbajal and her mother had a fight about Maria’s boyfriend who lived with her family. Angry Maria packed some clothes took her mother’s van and left home with her brother Osiel her boyfriend and another friend. Teresa Chaparro Maria and Osiel’s mother waited to call the police. She was afraid they would arrest the children. But after two days Chaparro went to the Wadesboro police station and talked to an officer who sent out an alert that the teens were missing. The next night Osiel who had no license was driving 70 mph in a 45 mph zone on Highway 74 when Motsinger saw the van speed past and gave chase. Osiel pulled over at first but told The Post that one of the teens in the car warned: If they got into trouble they would be arrested. Everyone told him to go he said. Osiel sped off. They were only a few miles from his home. “I felt like if I could get to where my mom was she could help me” Osiel said. Motsinger asked a dispatcher to contact police ahead and ask whether they had “stop sticks” spiked strips that could be dropped into the roadway to disable the van’s tires. No she replied according to audio of the radio conversation. He asked whether he should PIT the van. A supervisor asked whether there were other people in the vehicle. At the time North Carolina had no speed restriction on PIT maneuvers used by officers such as Motsinger who had undergone more extensive training. But the policy prohibited troopers from using the maneuver if the fleeing vehicle was believed to be carrying “children or other innocent passengers.” “I saw at least one other occupant” Motsinger said over the radio. “I don’t know how many.” Motsinger added that traffic was light and the area was clear. “You think he’s 55?” the supervisor asked using police radio code for an intoxicated driver. Motsinger said he did. The supervisor gave him the go-ahead to PIT. Seventeen miles into the chase Motsinger closed in and his front-left quarter panel caught the back-right side of the van. Osiel lost control and the minivan flipped end over end until it came to rest in the woods. Maria Carbajal died after a North Carolina trooper performed a PIT on the van she was riding in. (Family photo) The rear seat of the van where Maria Carbajal and her boyfriend Jonathan Thomas were sitting broke free throwing them from the vehicle. Police told Chaparro that Maria had died clutching Thomas who suffered a broken vertebra. A friend Kandy Castrejon who had been sitting in the front passenger seat also was ejected. Castrejon who liked to make videos of herself lip-syncing died a few days later. A report by the North Carolina Highway Patrol’s Collision Reconstruction Unit said the “maneuver was performed correctly in this crash.” A North Carolina Highway Patrol spokesperson called the deaths “tragic” but declined to comment further on the case. Motsinger could not be reached for comment and the department declined to make him available. Chaparro told The Post that the night of the crash she had been praying in church and gotten a chill and knew Maria was in trouble. When she got home her youngest daughter said the teens had stopped by the house but were scared they were in trouble and again left. She was getting ready for bed after midnight when the call came about the crash. When she arrived at the hospital she saw teams of doctors huddled around a thin girl and recognized Kandy Castrejon’s mother nearby. In the next room she saw Thomas Maria’s boyfriend. She went to the final room and saw her son Osiel sitting up on a table. Osiel asked about his sister. But she was already dead. The damage to the minivan full of teens after a North Carolina trooper performed a PIT maneuver. (North Carolina State Highway Patrol Collision Reconstruction Unit) After the crash the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation reviewed Motsinger’s use of the PIT and turned the findings over to the State Attorney General’s Office which cleared Motsinger of any wrongdoing. “It appears that all viable means of stopping the vehicle had been exhausted and the likelihood of serious injury or fatality to the public remained a major concern prior to Trooper Motsinger’s decision to utilize the PIT as a means to disable the vehicle” the attorney general’s office wrote in a February 2018 letter about its decision. “Trooper Motsinger was forced to make a split second judgment about the amount of force necessary in a situation that was very tense uncertain and rapidly evolving.” The families of Maria and Kandy sued the state alleging that Motsinger used excessive force was reckless and violated department policies. Motsinger they contended should have been aware that four teens were in the van. The case was settled in May for an undisclosed amount records show. Thomas said that after the crash he began to have haunting flashes of his friends flying around inside the van. He said he was overcome with regret for not doing more to stop Osiel from speeding away when they were stopped. Osiel was charged with a felony for eluding police and later pleaded guilty to a juvenile charge according to attorneys who represent the family. Osiel was not intoxicated the lawyers said. “It does not make sense to me that the police did that” Thomas said. “Why would you PIT maneuver a car over 100 mph? What did you accomplish in this? You killed two innocent people who had their whole life ahead of them because someone else decided to speed off.” As a result of the crash the North Carolina Highway Patrol in July 2017 revised its policy on the use of the PIT: Troopers are not allowed to PIT vehicles at more than 55 mph unless the fleeing driver has committed a felony or the use of deadly force is warranted. Chaparro said she regrets calling the police. “They did not need to kill my child” she said. “For what?” she asked through a translator. “I had not realized that Saturday when we went to work that it would be the last time I would talk to my daughter.” Julie Tate Steven Rich Ana Chacin and Justine Coleman contributed to this report which was published in partnership with the Investigative Reporting Workshop where Chacin and Coleman were fellows.

How turnout and swing voters could get Trump or Biden to 270,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/voter-turnout-270-trump-biden/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The 2020 election will come down to two important questions: Who actually votes and who do they vote for? Starting with the 2016 electorate explore how shifts in turnout and voting patterns for key demographic groups could affect the race. Either start with the example below or design your own scenario.Scenario: Biden improves on Clinton’s performance with White votersView Another Scenario?You’ve just seen what happens when voter margin and turnout change for White voters. What happens if you changed these for other demographics? Click on a preset scenario or try it yourself with our interactive below.Design my own scenario chartChoose a group and see how it could impact the election. The gray zoneon the controls represents shifts from 2016 to 2020 that are most plausible based on historic results.Howvoters could swing the 2020 electionThis analysis helps illustrate a long-running argument in political science: Is it a better strategy to try to win over swing voters or to persuade people who will probably support you to actually vote?Both are important but you may have noticed that in this graphic it’s a bit easier to flip states by changing the vote margin than by changing turnout. (We’re defining turnout as the share of voting-aged citizens – not registered voters – who cast a ballot.)That’s because persuading a swing voter to change sides nets two votes: plus one for you minus one for your opponent. Getting a new voter to cast a ballot is worth just one vote. Vote share also tends to shift more than turnout from election to election.This analysis is a simplification of the actual 2020 elections for several reasons.First we’re only allowing you to shift one demographic group at a time. Let’s say turnout among women increased by 10 percentage points in 2020. That could be caused by enthusiasm but also by changes to state laws that made voting easier. Those law changes would affect many groups of voters not just women.[Vote by mail: Which states allow absentee voting]Secondly demographic groups don’t actually shift en masse. In this analysis if you change Latinx voters to become five points more Republican nationwide that shift is applied equally to Latinx voters in every state. Cuban Americans in Florida are a more conservative voting bloc than Mexican Americans in Texas. In reality you wouldn’t necessarily expect to see the voters in these two states shift equally.This analysis is based on the demographics of the 2016 electorate. It doesn’t account for how the voting population in these states has changed since 2016. As a result some states that are changing more rapidly — such as Arizona and Texas — are considered in play for Democrats in 2020 but are relatively difficult to flip blue in this graphic.Our own understanding of whether and how people voted in 2016 is inexact based on big surveys such as the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey which measures turnout and a variety of surveys that measure how different groups voted. These estimates of the 2016 electorate also do not account for voting-age citizens that have lost their right to vote such as felons in many states.The voting simulations rely on estimates that lean on the highest-quality source available for turnout and vote preference of key groups at the national and state levels including the American National Election Studies validated voter survey network exit polls and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). Statistical modeling of the CCES was used to estimate support by educational attainment as well as other groups in states where stand-alone exit polls were not conducted.Because of the sample sizes in these states this graphic does not provide estimates for the smaller racial groups contained within the “Other” category such as Indigenous Americans. Nor does it provide estimates for most crosstabs such as combinations of age and gender.Additional design work by Madison Walls and Lucio Villa.

Pro-Trump youth group enlists teens in secretive campaign likened to a ‘troll farm,’ prompting rebuke by Facebook and Twitter,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/turning-point-teens-disinformation-trump/2020/09/15/c84091ae-f20a-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The messages have been emanating in recent months from the accounts of young people in Arizona seemingly expressing their own views — standing up for President Trump in a battleground state and echoing talking points from his reelection campaign.Far from representing a genuine social media groundswell however the posts are the product of a sprawling yet secretive campaign that experts say evades the guardrails put in place by social media companies to limit online disinformation of the sort used by Russia during the 2016 campaign.Teenagers some of them minors are being paid to pump out the messages at the direction of Turning Point Action an affiliate of Turning Point USA the prominent conservative youth organization based in Phoenix according to four people with independent knowledge of the effort. Their descriptions were confirmed by detailed notes from relatives of one of the teenagers who recorded conversations with him about the efforts.The campaign draws on the spam-like behavior of bots and trolls with the same or similar language posted repeatedly across social media. But it is carried out at least in part by humans paid to use their own accounts though nowhere disclosing their relationship with Turning Point Action or the digital firm brought in to oversee the day-to-day activity. One user included a link to Turning Point USA’s website in his Twitter profile until The Washington Post began asking questions about the activity.In response to questions from The Post Twitter on Tuesday suspended at least 20 accounts involved in the activity for “platform manipulation and spam.” Facebook also removed a number of accounts as part of what the company said is an ongoing investigation.The effort generated thousands of posts this summer on Twitter Facebook and Instagram according to an examination by The Post and an assessment by an independent specialist in data science. Nearly 4500 tweets containing identical content that were identified in the analysis probably represent a fraction of the overall output.The months-long effort by the tax-exempt nonprofit is among the most ambitious domestic influence campaigns uncovered this election cycle said experts tracking the evolution of deceptive online tactics.“In 2016 there were Macedonian teenagers interfering in the election by running a troll farm and writing salacious articles for money” said Graham Brookie director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “In this election the troll farm is in Phoenix.”The effort Brookie added illustrates “that the scale and scope of domestic disinformation is far greater than anything a foreign adversary could do to us.”Turning Point Action whose 26-year-old leader Charlie Kirk delivered the opening speech at this year’s Republican National Convention issued a statement from the group’s field director defending the social media campaign and saying any comparison to a troll farm was a “gross mischaracterization.”“This is sincere political activism conducted by real people who passionately hold the beliefs they describe online not an anonymous troll farm in Russia” the field director Austin Smith said in the statement.He said the operation reflected an attempt by Turning Point Action to maintain its advocacy despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic which has curtailed many traditional political events.“Like everyone else Turning Point Action’s plans for nationwide in-person events and activities were completely disrupted by the pandemic” Smith said. “Many positions TPA had planned for in field work were going to be completely cut but TPA managed to reimagine these roles and working with our marketing partners transitioned some to a virtual and online activist model.”The group declined to make Kirk available for an interview.The online salvo targeted prominent Democratic politicians and news organizations on social media. It mainly took the form of replies to their posts part of a bid to reorient political conversation.The messages — some of them false and some simply partisan — were parceled out in precise increments as directed by the effort’s leaders according to the people with knowledge of the highly coordinated activity most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the privacy of minors carrying out the work.One parent of two teenagers involved in the effort Robert Jason Noonan said his 16- and 17-year-old daughters were being paid by Turning Point to push “conservative points of view and values” on social media. He said they have been working with the group since about June adding in an interview “The job is theirs until they want to quit or until the election.”Four years ago the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency amplified Turning Point’s right-wing memes as part of Moscow’s sweeping interference aimed at boosting Trump according to expert assessments prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee. One report pointed specifically to the use of Turning Point content as evidence of Russia’s “deep knowledge of American culture media and influencers.”Now some technology industry experts contend that the effort this year by Turning Point shows how domestic groups are not just producing eye-catching online material but also increasingly using social media to spread it in disruptive or misleading ways.“It sounds like the Russians but instead coming from Americans” said Jacob Ratkiewicz a software engineer at Google whose academic research as a PhD student at Indiana University at Bloomington addressed the political abuse of social media.To some participants the undertaking feels very different. Notes from the recorded conversation with a 16-year-old participant — the authenticity of which was confirmed by The Post — indicate “He said it’s really fun and he works with his friends.” The participant through family members declined to comment.The social media users active in the campaign some of whom were using their real names identified themselves only as Trump supporters and young Republicans. One described herself simply as a high school sophomore interested in softball and cheerleading.Noonan 46 said “some of the comments may go too far” but cast the activity as a response to similar exaggerations by Democrats. “Liberals say things that are way out there and conservatives say things that are sometimes way out there or don’t have enough evidence.”Those recruited to participate in the campaign were lifting the language from a shared online document according to Noonan and other people familiar with the setup. They posted the same lines a limited number of times to avoid automated detection by the technology companies these people said. They also were instructed to edit the beginning and ending of each snippet to differentiate the posts slightly according to the notes from the recorded conversation with a participant.Noonan said his daughters sometimes work from an office in the Phoenix area and are classified as independent contractors not earning “horrible money” but also not making minimum wage. Relatives of another person involved said the minor is paid an hourly rate and can score bonuses if his posts spur higher engagement.Smith as part of written responses to The Post deferred specific questions about the financial setup to a “marketing partner” called Rally Forge which he said was running the program for Turning Point.Jake Hoffman president and chief executive of the Phoenix-based digital marketing firm confirmed the online workers were classified as contractors but declined to comment further on “private employment matters.” He did not respond to a question about the office setup.Addressing the use of centralized documents to prepare the messages Hoffman said in written responses “Every working team within my agency works out of dozens of collaborative documents every day as is common with all dynamic marketing agencies or campaign phone banks for example.”The messages have appeared mainly as replies to news articles about politics and public health posted on social media. They seek to cast doubt on the integrity of the electoral process asserting that Democrats are using mail balloting to steal the election — “thwarting the will of the American people” they alleged.The posts also play down the threat from covid-19 which claimed the life of Turning Point’s co-founder Bill Montgomery in July. One post which was spread across social media dozens of times suggested baselessly that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is inflating the death toll from the disease. (Most experts say deaths are probably undercounted.) Another pushed for schools to reopen reasoning “President Trump is not worried because younger people do very well while dealing with covid.”Much of the blitz was aimed squarely at Joe Biden the Democratic presidential nominee. The former vice president asserted one message “is being controlled by behind the scenes individuals who want to take America down the dangerous path towards socialism.”By seeking to rebut mainstream news articles the operation illustrates the extent to which some online political activism is designed to discredit the media.In removing accounts Tuesday Twitter pointed to policies specifying “You can’t artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts.” That includes “coordinating with or compensating others to engage in artificial engagement or amplification even if the people involved use only one account” according to Twitter.On Twitter the nearly verbatim language emanated from about two dozen accounts through the summer. The exact number of people posting the messages was not clear. Smith the Turning Point field director said “The number fluctuates and many have gone back to school.” Hoffman in an email said “Dozens of young people have been excited to share their beliefs on social media.”The Rally Forge leader is a city council member in Queen Creek Ariz. and a candidate for the state legislature.Some of the users at points listed their location as Gilbert Ariz. a suburb of Phoenix according to screen shots reviewed by The Post. Some followed each other on Twitter while most were following only a list of prominent politicians and media outlets.One was followed by a former member of Congress Republican Tim Huelskamp of Kansas who is on the Catholics for Trump advisory board. Huelskamp said he could not recall what led him to follow the account and was not familiar with the effort by Turning Point. But he praised the group for “doing a great job of messaging particularly with younger folks.”Several teenagers were using their real names or variations of their names while other accounts active in posting the pro-Trump messaging appeared to be operating under pseudonyms. The Post’s review found that some participants seem to maintain multiple accounts on Facebook which is a violation of the company’s policies.Explaining why the users do not disclose that they are being paid as political activists Hoffman said they are “using their own personal profiles and sharing their content that reflects their values and beliefs.” He pointed to the risk of online bullying as well as physical harm in explaining why “we’ve left how much personal and professional information they wish to share up to them.”The accounts on Twitter alone posted 4401 tweets with identical content not including slight variations of the language according to Pik-Mai Hui a PhD student in informatics at Indiana University at Bloomington who performed an analysis of the content at the request of The Post. The analysis found characteristics strongly suggestive of bots — such as double commas and dangling commas that often appear with automatic scripts — though at least some of the accounts were being operated by humans.While the messaging appears designed to seed pro-Trump content across social media said Kathleen Hall Jamieson a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication the act of repeated posting also helps instill the ideas among those performing the activity. In addition it familiarizes the users with the ways of online combat she said and makes their accounts valuable assets should different needs arise as the election nears.“There is a logic to having an army locally situated in a battleground state having them up and online and ready to be deployed” Jamieson said.Turning Point Action debuted as a 501(c)(4) organization last year with more leeway in undertaking political advocacy than is afforded to the original group which is barred from campaign activity as a 501(c)(3). Both nonprofits are required only to disclose the salaries of directors officers and key employees said Marc Owens a tax attorney with Loeb & Loeb.Turning Point dates to 2012 when Montgomery retired from a career in marketing heard Kirk then 18 deliver a speech in the Chicago suburbs at Benedictine University’s “Youth Government Day.” He called the address “practically Reaganesque” according to a 2015 profile in Crain’s Chicago Business newspaper and urged Kirk a former Eagle Scout to put off college in favor of full-time political activism. Kirk became the face of Turning Point while Montgomery was “the old guy who keeps it all legal” he told the business weekly.The organization amassed prominent and wealthy conservative allies including Richard Grenell the former ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence and Foster Friess who made a fortune in mutual funds and helps bankroll conservative and Christian causes. Both men sit on Turning Point’s honorary board.Its standing rose significantly as Trump came to power. Turning Point USA brought in nearly $80000 in contributions and other funds in the fiscal year ending June 2013 according to IRS filings a fraction of the $8 million it reported for 2017 and $11 million for 2018.The group which describes itself as the “largest and fastest-growing youth organization in America” claims to have a presence on more than 2000 college and high school campuses. It hosts activist conferences and runs an alumni program. It also maintains a “Professor Watchlist” designed to expose instructors who “discriminate against conservative students promote anti-American values and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.”Kirk the group’s president and co-founder has been embraced and promoted by Trump and his family. Speaking at Turning Point USA’s Teen Student Action Summit last year Trump hailed Kirk for building a “movement unlike anything in the history of our nation.” A quote attributed to Donald Trump Jr. who has appeared at numerous Turning Point events features prominently on the group’s website: “I’m convinced that the work by Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk will win back the future of America.”Kirk has returned the praise. In his speech at last month’s Republican nominating convention he extolled Trump as the “bodyguard of Western civilization.”Equally impassioned rhetoric marked the campaign on social media with posts asserting that Black Lives Matter protesters were “fascist groups . . . terrorizing American citizens” and decrying the “BLM Marxist agenda” among other incendiary language.Noonan said his wife a hairstylist monitors the online activity of their daughters more closely than he does and that their work is often a topic of conversation when the family convenes in the evening.“We are Trump supporters but one of the things my wife and I have been very consistent on is to always understand both sides and make decisions from there” the father said.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/turning-point-teens-disinformation-trump/2020/09/15/c84091ae-f20a-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Israel signs deal establishing formal ties with two Arab states at the White House,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-israel-middle-east/2020/09/15/e4c2630a-f75c-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The agreements mark the third and fourth Arab nations to normalize relations with Israel — and the first since Jordan took the step in 1994 following Egypt in 1979. Trump took full credit for setting the path and encouraging them to take it. A White House statement attributed the success to his “foreign policy vision and his acumen as a dealmaker.”But the countries involved Trump said Tuesday “had to make that choice themselves.”In formal remarks each leader delivered in turn from a podium set on the White House balcony looking down on the audience both Trump and Netanyahu said that other Arab countries were prepared to take the same step.At various points during the day Trump said that five six and “seven or eight or nine” Arab countries were queuing up to join. “Including the big ones” he told reporters as he returned to the South Lawn later in the day to depart for an evening trip to Philadelphia. Asked about Saudi Arabia he said that he had been in frequent contact with King Salman and that “at the right time I think they will come in.”The last-minute addition of Bahrain whose announcement that it would normalize ties with Israel followed that of the UAE with far less fanfare was seen as a sign of Saudi approval. The small island monarchy in the Persian Gulf is highly dependent on economic and security ties with the Saudis and closely coordinates its foreign policy with Riyadh.After finishing their speeches on the balcony — from which opera singers serenaded the Trump family when he accepted the Republican nomination for reelection less than three weeks ago — the four men walked down the sweeping outdoor staircase to sit at a long table facing the seated crowd said by the White House to number about 800.The United States Israel the UAE and Bahrain all signed the Abraham Accords — named for the three Abrahamic religions rooted in what is now Israel and surrounding lands — that lays the ground for diplomatic economic and other ties between Israel and the Persian Gulf neighbors. The two Arab states then signed bilateral agreements with Israel.In addition to their historic nature the agreements are also significant for relegating the Palestinians to the sidelines. Palestinian leaders have rejected the Trump peace efforts for three years charging that they benefited Israel and have called the two Arab nations traitors to their cause.Addressing reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Netanyahu Trump predicted that the Palestinians would eventually come on board. “Obviously we speak to them” he said even as he recalled that his administration had cut off $750 million in funding to the Palestinians because “they treat the United States so badly.”Neither the UAE nor Bahrain is or ever has been at war with Israel so the documents are not peace treaties in the formal sense. But until now both Persian Gulf states had officially considered Israel to be illegitimate.Arab states in the Persian Gulf have edged closer to Israel over the past decade some with extensive but largely unpublicized ties in response to a shared desire to blunt Iranian influence in the region.Trump greeted all three leaders in the Oval Office separately before the signing ceremony. As he sat there with Netanyahu he once again expressed a desire to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear program after earlier in his administration ripping up an accord reached by Tehran with the Obama administration to curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions.He said he had been in communications with Iranian representatives and told them “you should wait to see the [U.S.] election first.” Trump also said “there is nothing . . . Iran would like to see better than Sleepy Joe Biden elected.”But “I’m going to make a much better deal” he said predicting his own victory. “Iran will be very rich and very quickly.”The ceremony received wide and favorable attention in largely government-influenced news coverage throughout most of the Persian Gulf. One partial exception was in Qatar whose Al Jazeera online quoted a Palestinian Authority official calling the signing a “sad day.”“The only path for peace for the Palestinians is ending this brutal Israeli occupation and granting the Palestinians their inalienable rights for self-determination. Without that there is no path to peace in the region” Al Jazeera quoted Ammar Hijazi assistant minister of multilateral affairs for the Palestinian Authority as saying.Hijazi called the White House ceremony a “photo op” that “only crowns Israel as the policeman of the region” and paves the way for more U.S. weapons sales to the Arab countries.Qatar has ruled out normalization of ties with Israel until the Palestinians are granted their own state within borders from before Israel conquered significant territory in a 1967 war and with East Jerusalem as its capital. Those conditions are part of the Arab Peace Initiative written by Saudi Arabia and unanimously adopted by the Arab League in 2002 and which remains at least symbolically the group’s joint position.Of the four leaders at the White House only Abdullah bin Zayed the UAE foreign minister mentioned either of the two outstanding concerns that have been raised about the new accords. In exchange for normalization with the UAE Netanyahu agreed to suspend plans to annex Israeli-occupied parts of the West Bank but it remains unclear how long that suspension will last.“Thank you for choosing peace and for halting the annexation of Palestinian territories a position that reinforces our shared will to achieve a better future for generations to come” Zayed said in remarks directed at Netanyahu during his balcony speech.The other issue is what the White House has said is the potential sale of F-35s the sophisticated U.S. stealth fighter jet to the UAE. Only Israel has the planes in the Middle East and many Israelis as well as members of Congress have raised concerns that selling them to the Emiratis would violate U.S. law requiring a “qualitative military edge” for Israel in its neighborhood.The agreements have garnered widespread bipartisan support but lawmakers have expressed some concerns. In a statement House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) cited questions “regarding the commitment that the UAE has received from the Trump administration to purchase American-made F-35 aircraft.”“It is also critically important that we fully understand the agreements’ details regarding the announced freeze of efforts by Israel to annex portions of the West Bank” she said.Israelis watched the White House ceremony closely Tuesday evening with all TV channels halting regular broadcasts to bring live images from Washington.The broadcasts were interrupted only to report on a sudden round of rockets fired by Palestinian militants in Gaza as the leaders gave empowering speeches about forging peace.Air raid sirens sounded in the coastal cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon with Israeli police saying that a rocket had left two people injured. The rocket fire was seen by Israelis as a message of disapproval from the militant Islamic group Hamas which governs the Gaza Strip.In Israeli reports on the Washington ceremony close attention was paid to whether Netanyahu and members of his entourage were wearing masks and social distancing. As the novel coronavirus soars in Israel and the country heads into a second nationwide lockdown Friday the start of the Jewish High Holy Days Netanyahu’s decision to leave the country was closely scrutinized.Few masks were in evidence at the ceremony and no social distancing was enforced. In apparent deference to coronavirus protocols however there were no embraces or shaken hands among the leaders. Instead they saluted each other Middle Eastern-style with hands on their hearts.Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem and Felicia Sonmez in Washington contributed to this story.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-israel-middle-east/2020/09/15/e4c2630a-f75c-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Woodward says there was ‘denial across the board’ in White House about severity of coronavirus,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/woodward-trump-book-coronavirus/2020/09/15/34778718-f771-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“I think there was denial across the board” Woodward told The Post’s Philip Rucker when asked whether White House staffers who also knew about the lethality of the virus denied its severity. He added that Trump is “a one-man band” who is “going to do what he wants to do on impulse or on information he has.”“He’s a bulldozer to the staff and quite frankly to the country” Woodward said. “And he just says what he wants and so there’s no control. And this is one of the problems of the Trump presidency that he doesn’t build a team. He doesn’t plan.”Trump has criticized the book calling it “just another political hit job” and told “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday morning: “I read it very quickly. And it was very boring.”But he has also acknowledged that he knowingly minimized the danger posed to Americans by the virus although he insists that his actions did not amount to lying.Jared Kushner a White House senior adviser and Trump’s son-in-law defended the administration’s response to the coronavirus in an interview Tuesday morning on NBC News’s “Today” show.“The president was very forthcoming with the American people about what he knew and when he knew it” Kushner said.One of the steps that Trump has frequently touted amid the pandemic is his decision earlier this year to impose restrictions on travel from China to the United States. But Woodward said Tuesday that the action was actually suggested by others in the administration and did not originate with Trump.“My reporting shows that it was the doctors and the national security team that told the president that he needed to do this and he okayed it” Woodward said. “And if this was such a big deal he would have gone out and announced it. Instead he sent the secretary of health and human services [Alex] Azar to announce it.”In the Washington Post Live interview Woodward was also asked about Kushner’s claim to NBC News earlier Tuesday that Woodward “mischaracterized” who he was referring to when he said “The most dangerous people around the president are overconfident idiots.”In his book Woodward interprets the statement as a reference to former defense secretary Jim Mattis former secretary of state Rex Tillerson and former National Economic Council director Gary Cohn.Kushner did not deny Tuesday that he was referring to the three officials but he also did not clarify his remarks. “No that wasn’t clear. And again he’s got tapes of everything. I have tapes of everything. So that was never implied in that regard” he told NBC News’s Savannah Guthrie.Woodward responded that it was clear that Kushner was talking about individuals within the administration and that Trump dismissed both Mattis and Tillerson during interviews.He added: “I’m quite interested in when Jared says he has tapes. I have tapes. I taped him with his permission. I suspect that he was taping me. He did not extend the courtesy to me that he was taping the conversation. That’s fine and I report accurately what he said in the book and there are some much more important quotes from him quite frankly.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/woodward-trump-book-coronavirus/2020/09/15/34778718-f771-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Opinion | Deep-red Montana could be Democrats’ biggest catch in 2020. Can they land it?,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/deep-red-montana-could-be-democrats-biggest-catch-2020-can-they-land-it/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
This immense sparsely populated state appears to be a Republican’s dream. The state’s overwhelmingly White population and rural character — its largest city Billings has barely more than 100000 people — usually indicates a strong red tilt. But appearances can deceive. The state has elected only three Republican senators since World War I and hasn’t elected a Republican governor since 2000. Montanans regularly split their tickets and they did so again in 2018 by reelecting Democratic Sen. Jon Tester even as exit polls showed a majority of voters approved of President Trump’s job performance.Daines and his Democratic opponent two-term Gov. Steve Bullock are both political heavyweights. Both men grew up in Montana and returned from short stints out of state to raise their families in their hometowns and both have been involved in politics since their youth. Both know the state inside and out and both know the other is a smart capable foe.It’s easy to see why Democrats are high on Bullock. He has won three consecutive statewide elections even as Republicans swept presidential contests in Montana in those same years. Ruggedly handsome and gregarious he’s tailor-made for retail politics in a state small enough that most voters expect to meet their officeholders. He’s also sharp and quick. When I ask him how many guns he owns he shoots back with a perfect political answer for his individualistic state: “I don’t have to answer and the government doesn’t need to know.”Bullock casts the race as a question of who best represents Montana values. He claims a long record of working across party lines to solve problems for all Montanans whether it was freezing college tuition or expanding Medicaid. He notes that he won the state by four points in his 2016 reelection while Trump carried it by 20. “The same person you see in the grocery store” he tells me “is the person who will go to Washington to work for Montana’s interests.”Bullock takes aim at Daines as a servant of special interests. He contends that Daines’s vote for the Trump tax cuts shows he favors large corporations and the wealthy over average Montanans. He also argues that Daines’s acceptance of contributions from drug companies shows that “the special interests are his interests.” Bullock has particularly focused on Daines’s history of support for expanded trade with China noting that the senator spent part of his private-sector career with Procter & Gamble working in China and that he has led a number of trade missions to the Communist country during his tenure. The overall message is designed to appeal to Montana’s populist side that led the state to back progressives and New Deal Democrats for the first half of the 20th century and made it one of independent presidential candidate Ross Perot’s best states in 1992 and 1996.Daines however is ready for the fight. Genial rather than gregarious he is nonetheless a good fit for conservative Montana. He noted in our discussion that he received more votes in the state’s June primary than any candidate in Montana’s primary history. More than 382000 Montanans cast a primary ballot nearly three-quarters of the number who voted in the 2016 general election. Daines received roughly 48000 more votes than Bullock did in his primary; with those numbers Bullock would still trail Daines by more than 14000 votes even in the unlikely event that he captured every vote cast for someone other than the two men in both parties’ primaries. That’s a tough obstacle to overcome when both men are already so well known.That’s also one reason Daines tries to paint Bullock as a liberal who’s out of touch with today’s Montana values. He cites a litany of Bullock’s acts and statements including his vetoes of a bill banning sanctuary cities and the Born Alive Protection Act which requires doctors to try to save the life of a child born alive after an attempted abortion. Daines’s particular focus is on Bullock’s F-rating from the National Rifle Association. This is a reversal of the NRA’s prior more positive assessments of Bullock’s record caused by his changed positions on universal background checks and a ban on assault rifles. Fully 81 percent of Montana voters said they owned a firearm in the 2018 exit poll and the Daines campaign was flooding the airwaves with ads highlighting the NRA’s rating during my visit.Daines touts his ability to cross party lines to help Montana. Trump recently signed the Great American Outdoors Act a bipartisan bill Daines worked on that establishes full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. That’s a significant accomplishment in a state where access to public lands comes close to a state religion. He also cites work with Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on bills regarding forest management practices and extending eligibility for veterans to receive disability payments related to exposure to the deadly chemical Agent Orange.Public polls have shown this race within the margin of error all year an assessment neither campaign disputes. Polls taken in June and early July had Bullock slightly ahead while those taken since show Daines with a two- to six-point lead. All polls however show Trump beating former vice president Joe Biden in the state a reminder of the partisan hill Bullock must climb yet again to win.Bullock made that climb harder with a tweet and campaign video during his presidential primary run in which he said he would be a “single-issue voter ... mak[ing] sure Donald Trump is a one-term president.” He says that statement was made in the context of his campaign and that Montanans understood he would fight for their interests and work with Trump where possible if Trump is reelected. That might be but Bullock needs about 10 percent of Trump’s voters to cross party lines if he is to win. Expect Daines to hammer this comment home in television ads asking Trump backers to be “single-issue voters” themselves.Bullock might be able to reel Daines in by Election Day. But if he doesn’t he might think back to that comment as the reason this fish got away.Watch the latest Opinions video:,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/deep-red-montana-could-be-democrats-biggest-catch-2020-can-they-land-it/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

A Maryland suburb known for a slaveholding past confronts its racist present,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/maryland-news/anne-arundel-pasadena-black-lives-matter/2020/09/15/7dd0449a-d651-11ea-930e-d88518c57dcc_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The incident became a watershed moment in Anne Arundel County a glaring example of the intractable history of hate in a sprawling suburb of strip malls and subdivisions. Keemer’s teacher retired after the teenager and his parents came forward. At community meetings residents shared other experiences of racism — some recent some decades ago.When County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) was elected months later part of a 2018 blue wave fueled by opposition to President Trump he homed in on data showing that Pasadena reported the highest number of hate or bias incidents in Anne Arundel County which itself has recorded the most incidents in the state.That made Pasadena population 24287 unofficially the most hate-filled town in all of Maryland.Pittman launched studies about the impact of racism on Black and Brown communities in his county located midway between Baltimore and D.C. and championed a new law broadening the state’s hate-crime statute. Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis police custody accelerated his efforts as did research showing the disparate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on minorities in Anne Arundel and elsewhere.Now Pittman — whose ancestors were enslavers in Anne Arundel and who grew up on a farm where sharecroppers worked the land — is pushing for police body cameras and planning an office dedicated to racial justice and health equity. This summer he attended Black Lives Matter protests including one at Tick Neck Park in Pasadena organized by Shelyia Brown 20 who encouraged her peers to talk about their experiences with racism growing up.Terry Keemer Jr. Jordan’s father was there along with his wife Nichole and a White friend who attended Chesapeake High School with him decades earlier.Nicholaus R. Kipke a Republican lawmaker from Anne Arundel who is minority leader in the House of Delegates also attended. He too graduated from Chesapeake. But his reality was far different.And there was Pamela Jackson with her 26-year-old son Marcus Dentley. Their family were the first Black people to move to their Pasadena neighborhood 15 years ago.“I have two sons and I always have a concern when they leave the house” Jackson said explaining why she stayed at the protest despite a drenching summer rainstorm. “It’s important that Blacks are heard and it’s even more important for us to be heard in certain neighborhoods.”'Part of the culture'For decades local historians say Pasadena was known as a “sundown town” a place where Black residents risked harassment or worse if they were in certain locations after nightfall. “If you lived in the county you knew where you weren’t supposed to go” said Janice Hayes Williams a community activist and historian who grew up in nearby Annapolis.Five of the 42 Black people known to have been lynched in Maryland were killed in Anne Arundel County according to the Maryland Lynching Memorial Project. The last known lynching in the county was in 1906.But it is the recent rash of incidents — 78 reported in Anne Arundel in 2018 according to state police data 22 in Pasadena’s Zip code — that worries many longtime residents.Last year according to Pittman an effigy was hung from a tree on property owned by a Black former council member; a swastika was scrawled on a car in Annapolis; and the likeness of a lynching was spray-painted on a tennis court near where the county is expanding public access to a beach resort once restricted to Whites.Earlier this year a middle school student suspended a noose from a classroom ceiling.Carl Snowden a former Annapolis alderman who led the charge to ban discrimination in private clubs in 1990 said racism is “part of the culture” in Anne Arundel a county known for the historical state capital of Annapolis crabfests and the Naval Academy.But Annapolis was also a major hub of the slave trade used by Alex Haley in his famed “Roots” novel and television miniseries as the place where the character Kunta Kinte landed on a slave ship. And Anne Arundel is where segregationist George Wallace captured wins during his runs for president; where Black beaches survived late into the 20th century because Black people were barred from other county beaches on the Chesapeake Bay; and where a statue of Roger Brooke Taney author of the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision that upheld slavery and said Black people could not be U.S. citizens stood from 1887 until its removal three years ago.Some Black parents in Pasadena still talk to their children about which neighborhoods to avoid similar to the conversations many have with their children about police and traffic stops. Dentley said his father didn’t go into details during the discussion. He just said certain places were “dangerous.”One of his classmates he recalled would deliberately skirt one of those areas on his way to school. “It wasn’t about the distance but it was the inconvenience of having to do something like that” Dentley said in an interview after the rally.Pittman a former community organizer describes Anne Arundel as a microcosm of the nation as a whole. “We are urban rural suburban and what some might call a Rust Belt in northern county where we have the White working class that have lost income in this economy” he said. “We are America . . . a country built on a system of racial terror. . . . We say ‘liberty and justice for all’ [but] we know we’re not there.”Some of the county’s recent gestures were mostly symbolic like tweaking its motto from “The Best Place” to “The Best Place for All.” But the government also declared racism a public health issue and formed an Office of Health Equity and Racial Justice. Not everyone has been on board.“They say I’m being divisive that talking about race and racism is divisive” said Pittman who has been attacked on social media for his stance.He remains hopeful that the number of hate incidents reported in the county eventually will fall. But he says he is not surprised that preliminary data shows things getting worse.“I expect to see more hate and more anger” he said citing the pandemic the economic downturn and the political climate. “We have a president who is on television constantly trying to divide people on issues of race.”Painful memoriesBrown who grew up in Pasadena said she was shocked by the angry reaction on social media from some White residents when she organized the town’s first Black Lives Matter rally in June. One post threatened to burn down Tick Neck Park “before the protesters had a chance to set it on fire.” Another claimed to be developing a plan to show up with guns. Several others called her the n-word.But Brown was undeterred. And so were the nearly 100 Black White young and old individuals who stood on the open field for the second protest July 11 hoisting Black Lives Matter signs and wearing #OnePasadena buttons on their shirts.The rally dubbed #HearThe­Youth was an opportunity for minority teenagers to share their experiences growing up in Pasadena which is 81 percent White.One biracial teen recalled being accused of both not “being Black enough” and not “being White enough.”Another teen spoke about being ridiculed for her skin color.In an interview before the protest Brown recalled a White student at Northeast High School who threatened to hang a Black girl when she touched his pen.“It’s got to stop” Brown said. “My hope is that not only Black people but Hispanic kids Asian kids anyone who is different in color is treated with respect not treated like their parents don’t pay taxes to live where they are.”The rally was the second Terry Keemer Jr. had attended since Floyd’s killing. Next to him stood Craig Zuwallack his childhood friend wearing a T-shirt that read: “All Lives Can’t Matter Until Black Lives Matter.”Keemer 40 said he was there for his son but also for himself. He was once told by a teacher at Chesapeake that he didn’t need to take an algebra class because he would probably only become a janitor.Zuwallack says he was called a “n----- lover” and a “wigger” (a White n-word) because he had Black friends growing up. He recalls being in seventh or eighth grade walking with some of those friends when someone in a pickup truck threw a bottle out of their window and yelled “Get the f--- off the street you n-----s.”Racist views are generational similar to family traditions Zuwallack said in an interview. His grandfather believed that Black and White people shouldn’t mix and would often tell Zuwallack that he “would never be as good at basketball because Black people have an extra muscle in their leg.”Zuwallack paused as he recounted the story. “And this comes from a very intelligent man.”His parents he added broke away from all that.Keemer said he remembered when Jordan who is biracial called him and his wife from the school bus to tell them about his teacher using a racial slur. It wasn’t the first time someone had called Jordan the n-word. When he was 14 Jordan said a driver yelled the word while he and his friends walked down the street.Terry Keemer said that’s part of the reason his eyes welled at the first rally he attended. He looked out and saw a sea of people mostly White who had come to say “Black lives matter.” It gave Keemer hope for the future.“The youth are leading the way and I don’t want them to stand alone” he said wearing a T-shirt with the words “My Skin Color Is Not a Crime.”An unnoticed realityKipke the GOP leader in the House of Delegates remembers the comment made by Jordan Keemer’s teacher too. After the family reported it Kipke sat at community meetings listening to Black residents talk about being called racial slurs and bullied. The veteran lawmaker who is White didn’t understand how such a thing could have happened at the high school he attended about 20 years earlier. “There isn’t racism” he kept saying to himself. At least not that he was aware of. “A lot of people like me are like: ‘What are you talking about? I didn’t see it when I was in school.’ ”Seeking to understand Kipke said he called a Black former classmate and asked if he felt like he was treated differently in school because of his race.Of course the person said. Teachers ignored him. One student called him the n-word whenever he walked by him. Kipke called another Black former classmate. He heard similar stories.“It made me sad” he said. “You hear the stories and it’s sad.”Kipke said he doesn’t think Pasadena is much different from other towns across Maryland. Rather he suspects that the spotlight on Keemer’s situation raised awareness and led to increased reporting. The majority of hate incidents reported in the town in 2018 involved incidents at Chesapeake High.Still regardless of the number Kipke said the mistreatment of Black people because of their skin color is “wrong immoral.”He vowed to continue engaging with Black residents on solutions and said he is closely watching the work being done by a group of lawmakers who will recommend policing policy changes in Maryland. He is especially interested in no-knock warrants since the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor by police in Louisville this spring.Kipke said his concern about racism and potential bias in policing does not negate his support for officers. “Police officers being painted as corrupt I reject that” he said. “And painting America as a horrible place I reject that.”When a community activist at the July rally asked him if he’d wear a Black Lives Matter pin Kipke declined opting for a #OnePasadena button instead.“Uppercase Black Lives Matter that organization is political in nature that is an organization aimed at social justice a political philosophy that I don’t agree with” Kipke said. “Lowercase Black lives matter I’m supportive of every person in my community . . . and I’m going to stand up for them.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/maryland-news/anne-arundel-pasadena-black-lives-matter/2020/09/15/7dd0449a-d651-11ea-930e-d88518c57dcc_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Louisville agrees to $12 million payout and policing changes in agreement with family of Breonna Taylor, killed in police raid,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/15/breonnataylorlouisvillesettlement/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The settlement which follows a wrongful-death lawsuit that Taylor’s family filed in May requires police commanders to approve all search warrant applications that are submitted to a judge said Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer (D) during a news conference Tuesday afternoon. Louisville police will also have to conduct extensive risk assessments before applying for a warrant.At least two officers now will be required to have their body cameras turned on when money seized during an investigation is impounded being counted or processed Fischer said. And in an effort to bolster the police department’s ties to the community officers will be given up to two hours per week of paid time for community service and the department will explore incentives for officers to live within certain low-income areas of the city.The city also has agreed to hire more mental health experts and pair them up with officers who respond to calls Fischer said.“This settlement is of mutual interest” said Sam Aguiar an attorney for the Taylor family in an interview Tuesday. “The city was able to afford this level of justice and Breonna Taylor’s mother has been adamant from day one that reform was needed to reduce the likelihood that no other family has to endure this type of tragedy.”The settlement follows weeks of private talks between the two parties Aguiar said.“This is probably the largest settlement for police misconduct in the history of Louisville and includes substantial police reform as well” he said.The settlement does not include an admission of wrongdoing by the city or the police officers involved in the raid Fischer said. Lonita Baker another attorney for the Taylor family said her clients did not plan to file additional lawsuits.“Today alone is not enough” said Jefferson County Attorney Mike O’Connell. “I hope this agreement is the next step in bringing a more just Louisville. A more just Louisville is the medicine we need to heal.”Settlement amounts in fatal police shootings vary widely. In a 2015 Washington Post account of awards in civil lawsuits payouts ranged from $7500 to $8.5 million. Last year the city of Minneapolis settled a lawsuit with the family of 40-year-old Justine Ruszczyk Damond who was shot by an officer after calling 911 about a possible crime for $20 million.Some of the highest-profile deaths in police custody in recent years have resulted in settlements around $6 million. New York City in 2015 resolved a lawsuit with the family of Eric Garner an unarmed Black man who died after being put in a police chokehold for $5.9 million. Baltimore agreed to pay $6.4 million to the family of Freddie Gray who died a week after suffering a severe spinal injury while handcuffed in a police van. And the city of Cleveland settled a lawsuit with the family of 12-year-old Tamir Rice who was shot while playing with a toy gun in a park for $6 million in 2016.Louisville’s settlement with Taylor’s family will not affect the ongoing investigation by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R) of whether the officers who raided Taylor’s apartment should face criminal charges stemming from her death. The Justice Department is also investigating the case.The Taylor family attorneys signaled they would continue their demands that criminal charges be filed. Attorney Benjamin Crump called on the state attorney general to charge the officers involved in the raid “immediately this week” with “at the very minimum second-degree manslaughter charges.”“Justice for Breonna Taylor is multilayered” Baker added. “What we were able to accomplish today through the civil settlement against the officers is tremendous but it is only a portion of a single layer.”Activists who have been protesting Taylor’s death for months said they too would keep calling for criminal charges.“No amount of money will bring back Breonna Taylor. We see this settlement as the bare minimum that one can do ” Until Freedom a New York-based group that has been heavily involved in making Taylor’s case a defining symbol of the racial justice movement said in a statement. “True justice is not served with cash settlements. … We need accountability. We need justice.”At the news conference Until Freedom co-founder Tamika Mallory demanded that Fischer fire all of the officers involved in Taylor’s killing if Cameron’s office does not indict them. Fischer declined to make that promise.Experts meanwhile expressed skepticism that the announced policing overhauls were as significant as officials portrayed them to be.Geoffrey P. Alpert a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina said he was surprised that Louisville police did not already require commanders to approve warrants and provide incentives for officers to live in the city. Those policies are common practices in police departments across the country he said.“If they’ve never had that in Louisville this is going to be a big improvement” said Alpert who is also a co-author of “Evaluating Police Uses of Force.” “This is going to be meaningful. It’s just shocking or a shame that this is new to Louisville.”Eugene O’Donnell a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice said he doubts that the changes in how search warrants are carried out will make people safer in police raids. He said the best solution is for police agencies to execute fewer search warrants especially when they deal with nonviolent crimes such as drug investigations.“You can candidly have a conversation with the community and say ‘Those days are over and we don’t do that anymore’” O’Donnell said. “Going into a stranger’s home who may have a firearm is going to be dangerous especially in this environment where policing is three times as hard.”O’Donnell added that a reform-minded police department should be looking for ways to reduce “physical-force policing.” He said the public and increasingly police themselves are seeking out solutions that involve fewer face-to-face encounters between officers and suspects.“People are demanding an end to violence … and a lot less policing” O’Donnell said. “If you know who these people are you can identify them you can submit evidence to court you can ask them to surrender and seek their appearance.”In the eyes of Phillip Atiba Goff co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Center for Policing Equity Louisville’s policing changes address bureaucratic issues but fail to confront deeper problems in law enforcement’s mission. He said Louisville’s policing overhauls wrongly treat Taylor’s death as a tragic mistake in a mostly functional system.“What do you say then to the young Black man or woman young trans woman who says ‘I don’t think this is an error. I think this is baked into how and why law enforcement operates’?” Goff said. “This set of solutions has nothing to say to that person.”Chanelle Helm a lead organizer for Black Lives Matter Louisville said protests are still occurring in the city nearly every day and Tuesday’s settlement will do nothing to slow them. Helm said Taylor’s death has now come to represent the broader fight for racial justice and many of those issues have still not been addressed.“I think [Taylor’s] legal team feels like they have gone as far as they can go” said Helm 40 who is Black. “But for us on the front lines who are fighting to defund the police fighting for our neighborhoods and fighting for justice. ... We know this fight is not over.”Taylor was killed March 13 when plainclothes police officers carried out a “no-knock” search warrant at her home shortly after midnight as part of a drug investigation. Taylor was asleep at the time according to the family lawsuit.Her boyfriend Kenneth Walker 27 who was also at the apartment fired a shot with a gun he legally owned and later said he thought the officers were intruders. The officers shot back and Taylor was struck five times.The officers said they identified themselves before forcing in the door to Taylor’s apartment with a battering ram but Taylor’s family disputes that claim in the lawsuit. Police did not find drugs at the home.Although Walker was initially charged with the attempted murder of a law enforcement officer the charges were dropped. Louisville has since banned the use of no-knock warrants.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/15/breonnataylorlouisvillesettlement/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Woodward says there was ‘denial across the board’ in White House about severity of coronavirus,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/woodward-trump-book-coronavirus/2020/09/15/34778718-f771-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“I think there was denial across the board” Woodward told The Post’s Philip Rucker when asked whether White House staffers who also knew about the lethality of the virus denied its severity. He added that Trump is “a one-man band” who is “going to do what he wants to do on impulse or on information he has.”“He’s a bulldozer to the staff and quite frankly to the country” Woodward said. “And he just says what he wants and so there’s no control. And this is one of the problems of the Trump presidency that he doesn’t build a team. He doesn’t plan.”Trump has criticized the book calling it “just another political hit job” and told “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday morning: “I read it very quickly. And it was very boring.”But he has also acknowledged that he knowingly minimized the danger posed to Americans by the virus although he insists that his actions did not amount to lying.Jared Kushner a White House senior adviser and Trump’s son-in-law defended the administration’s response to the coronavirus in an interview Tuesday morning on NBC News’s “Today” show.“The president was very forthcoming with the American people about what he knew and when he knew it” Kushner said.One of the steps that Trump has frequently touted amid the pandemic is his decision earlier this year to impose restrictions on travel from China to the United States. But Woodward said Tuesday that the action was actually suggested by others in the administration and did not originate with Trump.“My reporting shows that it was the doctors and the national security team that told the president that he needed to do this and he okayed it” Woodward said. “And if this was such a big deal he would have gone out and announced it. Instead he sent the secretary of health and human services [Alex] Azar to announce it.”In the Washington Post Live interview Woodward was also asked about Kushner’s claim to NBC News earlier Tuesday that Woodward “mischaracterized” who he was referring to when he said “The most dangerous people around the president are overconfident idiots.”In his book Woodward interprets the statement as a reference to former defense secretary Jim Mattis former secretary of state Rex Tillerson and former National Economic Council director Gary Cohn.Kushner did not deny Tuesday that he was referring to the three officials but he also did not clarify his remarks. “No that wasn’t clear. And again he’s got tapes of everything. I have tapes of everything. So that was never implied in that regard” he told NBC News’s Savannah Guthrie.Woodward responded that it was clear that Kushner was talking about individuals within the administration and that Trump dismissed both Mattis and Tillerson during interviews.He added: “I’m quite interested in when Jared says he has tapes. I have tapes. I taped him with his permission. I suspect that he was taping me. He did not extend the courtesy to me that he was taping the conversation. That’s fine and I report accurately what he said in the book and there are some much more important quotes from him quite frankly.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/woodward-trump-book-coronavirus/2020/09/15/34778718-f771-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Opinion | Trump seems to believe in magic over science,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-need-a-president-who-sees-science-as-a-solution-not-the-enemy/2020/09/15/a13e3378-f745-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“Well I don’t think science knows actually” Trump replied.Sound familiar? This is the same president who has insisted — repeatedly — that the novel coronavirus would simply “go away.”“It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear” he said in February when U.S. coronavirus cases still numbered in the dozens.As we now know from what he told Bob Woodward at the time the president knew that the virus was far more dangerous than he was telling the country.Had Trump been more honest about the threat he might have generated great support for social distancing or put in place a widespread testing regimen as other countries did potentially blunting the impact of covid-19.Instead the president continues to thumb his nose at safety measures. On Sunday night he held an indoor rally in Henderson Nev. Thousands of his supporters packed a warehouse disregarding a state order limiting indoor gatherings to 50 people.“We are already making the turn. We’re making that round beautiful last turn” to a post-pandemic future Trump told the generally mask-free crowd.None of this comports with reality. The country is approaching a grim milestone of 200000 covid-19 deaths.Yet Trump expects Americans to suspend any doubts that a safe and effective vaccine could be available by “a very special date. You know what date I’m talking about.”That date of course is Nov. 3 which happens to be Election Day. Scientific advancement is worth pursuing Trump apparently believes if it aligns with his political advancement.Even if a vaccine is rolled out by year’s end Anthony S. Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases cautions that life will not return to anything that resembles pre-pandemic normal until the middle or end of 2021.Meanwhile as Fauci tries to temper expectations for the days and months ahead the administration gave a conspiracy theorist and Trump sycophant a leading role in shaping the Department of Health and Human Services’ messaging.Michael Caputo was appointed assistant secretary of public affairs in April despite having no background in health care. He came under fire in recent days for his efforts to manipulate and quash the weekly reports by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which painted a less rosy picture than Trump does about the pandemic.On Sunday Caputo went on an unhinged rant on Facebook Live first reported by the New York Times in which he claimed that CDC scientists who put out data undercutting the president’s version of reality are engaging in “sedition.”“There are scientists who work for this government who do not want America to get well not until after Joe Biden is president” Caputo claimed. His 26-minute tirade included urging Trump supporters to prepare for armed conflict with left-wing “hit squads” after the election: “If you carry guns buy ammunition ladies and gentlemen because it’s going to be hard to get.”Caputo apologized on Tuesday and said he is considering a leave of absence. But the question remains: Why was a political operative put in such a critical job during a mounting national health emergency?Meanwhile Scientific American the country’s oldest continuously published monthly magazine has broken 175 years of tradition and for the first time endorsed a candidate for president.“The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the U.S. and its people — because he rejects evidence and science. The most devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic which cost more than 190000 Americans their lives by the middle of September” editors wrote. “He has also attacked environmental protections medical care and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges.”They added: “That is why we urge you to vote for Joe Biden who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health our economy and the environment.”Imagine how refreshing it would be to have a president who sees science as a solution not the enemy.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-need-a-president-who-sees-science-as-a-solution-not-the-enemy/2020/09/15/a13e3378-f745-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
A Maryland suburb known for a slaveholding past confronts its racist present,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/maryland-news/anne-arundel-pasadena-black-lives-matter/2020/09/15/7dd0449a-d651-11ea-930e-d88518c57dcc_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The incident became a watershed moment in Anne Arundel County a glaring example of the intractable history of hate in a sprawling suburb of strip malls and subdivisions. Keemer’s teacher retired after the teenager and his parents came forward. At community meetings residents shared other experiences of racism — some recent some decades ago.When County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) was elected months later part of a 2018 blue wave fueled by opposition to President Trump he homed in on data showing that Pasadena reported the highest number of hate or bias incidents in Anne Arundel County which itself has recorded the most incidents in the state.That made Pasadena population 24287 unofficially the most hate-filled town in all of Maryland.Pittman launched studies about the impact of racism on Black and Brown communities in his county located midway between Baltimore and D.C. and championed a new law broadening the state’s hate-crime statute. Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis police custody accelerated his efforts as did research showing the disparate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on minorities in Anne Arundel and elsewhere.Now Pittman — whose ancestors were enslavers in Anne Arundel and who grew up on a farm where sharecroppers worked the land — is pushing for police body cameras and planning an office dedicated to racial justice and health equity. This summer he attended Black Lives Matter protests including one at Tick Neck Park in Pasadena organized by Shelyia Brown 20 who encouraged her peers to talk about their experiences with racism growing up.Terry Keemer Jr. Jordan’s father was there along with his wife Nichole and a White friend who attended Chesapeake High School with him decades earlier.Nicholaus R. Kipke a Republican lawmaker from Anne Arundel who is minority leader in the House of Delegates also attended. He too graduated from Chesapeake. But his reality was far different.And there was Pamela Jackson with her 26-year-old son Marcus Dentley. Their family were the first Black people to move to their Pasadena neighborhood 15 years ago.“I have two sons and I always have a concern when they leave the house” Jackson said explaining why she stayed at the protest despite a drenching summer rainstorm. “It’s important that Blacks are heard and it’s even more important for us to be heard in certain neighborhoods.”'Part of the culture'For decades local historians say Pasadena was known as a “sundown town” a place where Black residents risked harassment or worse if they were in certain locations after nightfall. “If you lived in the county you knew where you weren’t supposed to go” said Janice Hayes Williams a community activist and historian who grew up in nearby Annapolis.Five of the 42 Black people known to have been lynched in Maryland were killed in Anne Arundel County according to the Maryland Lynching Memorial Project. The last known lynching in the county was in 1906.But it is the recent rash of incidents — 78 reported in Anne Arundel in 2018 according to state police data 22 in Pasadena’s Zip code — that worries many longtime residents.Last year according to Pittman an effigy was hung from a tree on property owned by a Black former council member; a swastika was scrawled on a car in Annapolis; and the likeness of a lynching was spray-painted on a tennis court near where the county is expanding public access to a beach resort once restricted to Whites.Earlier this year a middle school student suspended a noose from a classroom ceiling.Carl Snowden a former Annapolis alderman who led the charge to ban discrimination in private clubs in 1990 said racism is “part of the culture” in Anne Arundel a county known for the historical state capital of Annapolis crabfests and the Naval Academy.But Annapolis was also a major hub of the slave trade used by Alex Haley in his famed “Roots” novel and television miniseries as the place where the character Kunta Kinte landed on a slave ship. And Anne Arundel is where segregationist George Wallace captured wins during his runs for president; where Black beaches survived late into the 20th century because Black people were barred from other county beaches on the Chesapeake Bay; and where a statue of Roger Brooke Taney author of the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision that upheld slavery and said Black people could not be U.S. citizens stood from 1887 until its removal three years ago.Some Black parents in Pasadena still talk to their children about which neighborhoods to avoid similar to the conversations many have with their children about police and traffic stops. Dentley said his father didn’t go into details during the discussion. He just said certain places were “dangerous.”One of his classmates he recalled would deliberately skirt one of those areas on his way to school. “It wasn’t about the distance but it was the inconvenience of having to do something like that” Dentley said in an interview after the rally.Pittman a former community organizer describes Anne Arundel as a microcosm of the nation as a whole. “We are urban rural suburban and what some might call a Rust Belt in northern county where we have the White working class that have lost income in this economy” he said. “We are America . . . a country built on a system of racial terror. . . . We say ‘liberty and justice for all’ [but] we know we’re not there.”Some of the county’s recent gestures were mostly symbolic like tweaking its motto from “The Best Place” to “The Best Place for All.” But the government also declared racism a public health issue and formed an Office of Health Equity and Racial Justice. Not everyone has been on board.“They say I’m being divisive that talking about race and racism is divisive” said Pittman who has been attacked on social media for his stance.He remains hopeful that the number of hate incidents reported in the county eventually will fall. But he says he is not surprised that preliminary data shows things getting worse.“I expect to see more hate and more anger” he said citing the pandemic the economic downturn and the political climate. “We have a president who is on television constantly trying to divide people on issues of race.”Painful memoriesBrown who grew up in Pasadena said she was shocked by the angry reaction on social media from some White residents when she organized the town’s first Black Lives Matter rally in June. One post threatened to burn down Tick Neck Park “before the protesters had a chance to set it on fire.” Another claimed to be developing a plan to show up with guns. Several others called her the n-word.But Brown was undeterred. And so were the nearly 100 Black White young and old individuals who stood on the open field for the second protest July 11 hoisting Black Lives Matter signs and wearing #OnePasadena buttons on their shirts.The rally dubbed #HearThe­Youth was an opportunity for minority teenagers to share their experiences growing up in Pasadena which is 81 percent White.One biracial teen recalled being accused of both not “being Black enough” and not “being White enough.”Another teen spoke about being ridiculed for her skin color.In an interview before the protest Brown recalled a White student at Northeast High School who threatened to hang a Black girl when she touched his pen.“It’s got to stop” Brown said. “My hope is that not only Black people but Hispanic kids Asian kids anyone who is different in color is treated with respect not treated like their parents don’t pay taxes to live where they are.”The rally was the second Terry Keemer Jr. had attended since Floyd’s killing. Next to him stood Craig Zuwallack his childhood friend wearing a T-shirt that read: “All Lives Can’t Matter Until Black Lives Matter.”Keemer 40 said he was there for his son but also for himself. He was once told by a teacher at Chesapeake that he didn’t need to take an algebra class because he would probably only become a janitor.Zuwallack says he was called a “n----- lover” and a “wigger” (a White n-word) because he had Black friends growing up. He recalls being in seventh or eighth grade walking with some of those friends when someone in a pickup truck threw a bottle out of their window and yelled “Get the f--- off the street you n-----s.”Racist views are generational similar to family traditions Zuwallack said in an interview. His grandfather believed that Black and White people shouldn’t mix and would often tell Zuwallack that he “would never be as good at basketball because Black people have an extra muscle in their leg.”Zuwallack paused as he recounted the story. “And this comes from a very intelligent man.”His parents he added broke away from all that.Keemer said he remembered when Jordan who is biracial called him and his wife from the school bus to tell them about his teacher using a racial slur. It wasn’t the first time someone had called Jordan the n-word. When he was 14 Jordan said a driver yelled the word while he and his friends walked down the street.Terry Keemer said that’s part of the reason his eyes welled at the first rally he attended. He looked out and saw a sea of people mostly White who had come to say “Black lives matter.” It gave Keemer hope for the future.“The youth are leading the way and I don’t want them to stand alone” he said wearing a T-shirt with the words “My Skin Color Is Not a Crime.”An unnoticed realityKipke the GOP leader in the House of Delegates remembers the comment made by Jordan Keemer’s teacher too. After the family reported it Kipke sat at community meetings listening to Black residents talk about being called racial slurs and bullied. The veteran lawmaker who is White didn’t understand how such a thing could have happened at the high school he attended about 20 years earlier. “There isn’t racism” he kept saying to himself. At least not that he was aware of. “A lot of people like me are like: ‘What are you talking about? I didn’t see it when I was in school.’ ”Seeking to understand Kipke said he called a Black former classmate and asked if he felt like he was treated differently in school because of his race.Of course the person said. Teachers ignored him. One student called him the n-word whenever he walked by him. Kipke called another Black former classmate. He heard similar stories.“It made me sad” he said. “You hear the stories and it’s sad.”Kipke said he doesn’t think Pasadena is much different from other towns across Maryland. Rather he suspects that the spotlight on Keemer’s situation raised awareness and led to increased reporting. The majority of hate incidents reported in the town in 2018 involved incidents at Chesapeake High.Still regardless of the number Kipke said the mistreatment of Black people because of their skin color is “wrong immoral.”He vowed to continue engaging with Black residents on solutions and said he is closely watching the work being done by a group of lawmakers who will recommend policing policy changes in Maryland. He is especially interested in no-knock warrants since the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor by police in Louisville this spring.Kipke said his concern about racism and potential bias in policing does not negate his support for officers. “Police officers being painted as corrupt I reject that” he said. “And painting America as a horrible place I reject that.”When a community activist at the July rally asked him if he’d wear a Black Lives Matter pin Kipke declined opting for a #OnePasadena button instead.“Uppercase Black Lives Matter that organization is political in nature that is an organization aimed at social justice a political philosophy that I don’t agree with” Kipke said. “Lowercase Black lives matter I’m supportive of every person in my community . . . and I’m going to stand up for them.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/maryland-news/anne-arundel-pasadena-black-lives-matter/2020/09/15/7dd0449a-d651-11ea-930e-d88518c57dcc_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Ken Jennings on his new ‘Jeopardy!’ producer gig, Alex Trebek and filming the show in a pandemic,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/09/15/jeopardy-returns-ken-jennings-producer/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“He said ‘Hey we’ve been talking and if you’re serious about being retired from ‘Jeopardy!’ would you want to come aboard? Like move to the front office?’ ” Jennings recalled in a phone interview. “That was nice because I was kind of already missing the show.” (And no he also can’t believe that the tournament aired before the pandemic shut everything down. “Who knew that the GOAT tournament would be the last thing in human history textbooks?” he joked.)So that’s how Jennings officially joined the staff of “Jeopardy!” — which debuted its 37th season Monday — as a consulting producer. His new responsibilities include what he calls a “vague portfolio”: contestant outreach consultations about clue writing appearing in video clues (his first one airs Tuesday) and just generally being an ambassador for the show which he has already been doing informally.“I’ve been watching for 36 37 years so I have the fan’s point of view and I have the contestant’s point of view; I’ve played more hours of ‘Jeopardy!’ than anybody on the planet” said Jennings 46. “So I thought: I’m probably going to be doing this type of stuff for free anyway why not get on the payroll?”As with most Hollywood productions the show stopped filming in the spring because of the novel coronavirus so fans missed out on eight weeks of new episodes — not bad considering but still a disappointment for viewers who watch it religiously every night. Jennings calls “Jeopardy!” the ultimate comfort food which is something especially valuable in a time of pure chaos.“It’s a little slice of normality every night for half an hour” Jennings said. “Every time you see ‘Jeopardy!’ you’re in some timeless space where you’re reminded of all the other times you saw it and how you used to watch it with Grandma or watch it in the dorm in college whatever it is. It’s real continuity in our culture and there’s not much of that especially nowadays.”The show is back to filming in the studio — but with strict pandemic-related precautions including only a very small crew on site refitting the set so there’s more space between contestants and no studio audience. Host Alex Trebek’s health is also obviously a priority; he was diagnosed last year with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.Jennings said he heard that no one was saddened more by the unexpected pandemic hiatus than Trebek.“Despite battling cancer and being 80 years old he could not wait to get back to work” Jennings said. “ ’Jeopardy!’ still tapes five shows in a day. That’s a long and grueling day … and Alex just thrives on it from what I hear. He’s having good days and bad days but he can still do the job and enjoy it.”Meanwhile millions of viewers will also be thrilled to have the distraction of “Jeopardy!” back especially as everything (TV social media the country) starts to become more election-centric than ever. Miraculously “Jeopardy!” may be the one bipartisan thing we have left in our culture.“You think it would be the post office or national parks or public airwaves but then all those things have been politicized” Jennings said dryly. “But ‘Jeopardy!’ has been studiously apolitical and I think not by design but just by the strength of the format it’s enormously popular with both Americas. Nobody has a bad thing to say about ‘Jeopardy!’ ”“I think that’s good” he added “because it does represent this half-hour every night where actually questions have answers and correct answers and facts matter. That’s important to have some universally agreed-upon outpost of that on the airwaves.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/09/15/jeopardy-returns-ken-jennings-producer/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Los Angeles County sheriff says LeBron James should match reward in shooting of deputies,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/lebron-james-los-angeles-deputies/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“This challenge is to LeBron James. I want you to match that and double that reward” Villanueva said Monday. “I know you care about law enforcement. You expressed a very interesting statement about your perspective on race relations and on officer-involved shootings and the impact that it has on the African American community. And I appreciated that. But likewise we need to appreciate that respect for life goes across professions across races creeds and I’d like to see LeBron James step up to the plate and double that.”James as of Tuesday had not replied. While playing inside the NBA’s bubble this summer in Florida James and others have worn Black Lives Matter shirts and the league briefly halted the playoffs after Jacob Blake was wounded in Kenosha Wis. James has called for justice for Breonna Taylor an unarmed Louisville EMT who was shot and killed when officers entered her apartment on a no-knock warrant in March. The city of Louisville reached agreement on a settlement with Taylor’s family but an investigation continues into whether the officers who raided Taylor’s apartment should face criminal charges.“I know people get tired of hearing me say it but we are scared as a Black people in America” James said after Blake was shot. “Black men Black women Black kids we are terrified.” After the killing of Ahmaud Arbery he tweeted “We’re literally hunted every day.”In July James who donated bikes to police in his Akron Ohio hometown in 2008 said: “You guys don’t understand unless you’re a person of color. I understand you might feel for us but you can never really truly understand what it is to be Black in America … In 2016 Barack [Obama] was our president. We know what’s going on now. Is that progress? I think we can all sit here and say that’s not progress. The conversations that are being had right now how many people are really listening I think that’s progress. We’ve got a long way to go.”Villanueva’s department came under fire last winter when deputies shared graphic photos of the helicopter crash in which Kobe Bryant his daughter Gianna and seven others died. Bryant’s widow Vanessa weighed in on Villanueva’s challenge Tuesday responding to a question from a social media user who asked how Villanueva “could talk about trusting the system” after the January crash images had been shared.Sharing a headline about Villanueva’s plea to James as well as one about the deputies’ photos of the crash on an Instagram Live video Vanessa Bryant wrote: “Not all deputies are bad apples. Prayers for the two deputies who were shot.”Tensions in Compton a South Los Angeles community with a large Black population have been high after the fatal shooting of Dijon Kizzee on Aug. 31. Hundreds marched Saturday to the Compton sheriff’s station which is near where the deputies were shot to protest Kizzee’s killing and a small group of protesters gathered at the hospital where the deputies were taken. “When you’re sitting there doing paperwork and providing safety for the community and somebody from the public comes out and ambushes you and tries to kill you there’s no valid explanation for that” Ron Hernandez president of the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs said in a Monday news conference (via LA’s CBS affiliate). “I don’t care how angry the public I don’t care how angry even the people that might protest are. That’s not going to resolve anything.”More NBA coverage from The Post:,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/lebron-james-los-angeles-deputies/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Trump’s China tariffs violate global trade rules, WTO says,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/wto-trump-china-trade/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
A three-member WTO panel struck at the core of Trump’s trade war on China ruling that the tariffs he imposed more than two years ago on $234 billion worth of Chinese goods ran afoul of U.S. commitments under global trading rules.The ruling will have no immediate impact on U.S. customs officials’ ability to collect the levies from American importers but it represents a diplomatic dent in the president’s trade offensive.Several hours later the administration said it was abandoning a tariff on aluminum from Canada that the president had imposed just last month settling instead for making public its expectation that imports will decline. The move came hours before Chrystia Freeland Canada’s deputy prime minister who had vowed a “dollar for dollar” response was expected to announce retaliatory tariffs on American products.“Both actions reflect the iron law of trade retaliation. When the U.S. imposes import taxes on foreign goods other countries will hit back” said John Veroneau a partner at Covington & Burling and a former U.S. trade negotiator in the administration of President George W. Bush.That view has not always been accepted by senior Trump administration figures. In 2018 Peter Navarro one of the president’s closest trade advisers insisted that U.S. trading partners would not respond if the president made their products more expensive for American buyers.“I don’t believe any country is going to retaliate for the simple reason that we are the most lucrative and biggest market in the world” Navarro told Fox Business. “They know they’re cheating us and all we’re doing is standing up for ourselves.”The administration had argued before the WTO that its tariffs were needed to curb years of trade cheating by China. But in a 66-page report the panel rejected that claim.“The United States has not met its burden of demonstrating that the measures” are justified the panel concluded.Robert E. Lighthizer the U.S. trade representative issued a statement criticizing the decision saying it showed that the WTO was unable to prevent Chinese policies from distorting global trade and harming the U.S. economy. The president imposed the tariffs on Chinese goods following an investigation by Lighthizer’s office that concluded China routinely engaged in unfair trade practices including compelling foreign firms to transfer technology secrets and violating intellectual property safeguards.“Although the panel did not dispute the extensive evidence submitted by the United States of intellectual property theft by China its decision shows that the WTO provides no remedy for such misconduct. The United States must be allowed to defend itself against unfair trade practices and the Trump Administration will not let China use the WTO to take advantage of American workers businesses farmers and ranchers” Lighthizer said.In a separate announcement Lighthizer said the administration was dropping a 10 percent tariff on Canadian aluminum which took effect Aug. 16.The U.S. move followed consultations with the Canadian government and came as Canadian officials were preparing to unveil retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Lighthizer said the United States had scrapped its tariff plans based on “expectations” that Canadian shipments of the industrial metal would decline by 50 percent from levels during the first half of this year and he released specific permissible monthly totals for imports in each of the next four months.The United States reserves the right to reimpose the import levies if imports exceed 105 percent of those levels though Lighthizer’s statement effectively postpones any resumption of the tariff fight until after the election.Freeland bluntly described the U.S. decision as a “unilateral” one and reiterated that Canada would strike back against any future threats.“This is not a negotiated deal between Canada and the United States” she told reporters. “We have not agreed to anything. We have not negotiated an agreement with the United States on quotas.”The United States first imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum in 2018 citing the threat to national security from a reliance upon foreign suppliers. The president exempted Canada and Mexico from the levies the following year when a new North American trade pact was completed.When Trump announced last month that he was reimposing the aluminum tariffs citing an import surge Canadian officials said they would retaliate against $3.6 billion in U.S. goods including bicycles washing machines and refrigerators.The items were “explicitly targeted at products that were politically sensitive” and made in swing-state factories according to Eric Miller president of Rideau Potomac Strategy Group a trade consultancy.The on-again off-again nature of the president’s tariffs has confounded American businesses leaving many uncertain of their raw material costs from one month to the next. The Aluminum Association an industry group endorsed the decision to drop the tariffs which it called “disruptive and unnecessary.”The U.S. Chamber of Commerce which often has been critical of the administration’s tariff diplomacy also welcomed the move.“What American manufacturers need now is certainty that these tariffs won’t make another reappearance. Setting aside these threats once and for all will allow American job creators to focus on economic recovery” said Myron Brilliant executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber.In the case of the China tariffs the WTO ruling could eventually authorize China to impose higher tariffs on a range of U.S. products. But the United States can effectively stall any further action by appealing Tuesday’s ruling. The administration has blocked for months the appointment of new members to the WTO’s appellate body leaving the organization unable to fulfill its assigned role of adjudicating trade spats. The panel acknowledged its ruling comes amid “unprecedented global trade tensions.”Wendy Cutler vice president of the Asia Society said the verdict illustrated the weakness of the global trading regime established in 1995 with U.S. support.“In another era this ruling would have been the talk of the town in the trade community. But the finding comes as no surprise and without a fully operating appellate body it won’t have a consequential impact” said Cutler a former trade negotiator.China petitioned the WTO within weeks of the first U.S. tariffs arguing that the Trump administration had breached global trade rules by unilaterally imposing the import levies.The two countries subsequently negotiated a partial trade deal which was unveiled at a White House ceremony in January. The “phase one” deal called for China to buy an additional $200 billion from U.S. suppliers but left many of the administration’s broader complaints about Chinese state subsidies and trade practices for future negotiations.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/wto-trump-china-trade/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Big Oil’s green makeover ,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2020/09/15/bp-climate-change-transition/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Now BP one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies is aiming to ride the waves of disruption instead of being crushed under them.Led by a new chief executive BP is trying to reinvent itself as an energy company in the age of climate change. The company is shrinking its oil and gas business revving up offshore wind power and developing solar and battery storage. It is even considering installing electric car charging kiosks at its gas stations part of a drive to eliminate or offset its carbon emissions to a net zero level by 2050.There is much at stake because the century-and-a-half-old oil and natural gas business — unlike the business of home entertainment — has the ability to inflict even more lasting damage to the planet’s climate if it fails to act and continues to generate greenhouse gases.But BP is not just doing this out of altruism; it is making a business wager that low carbon energy will be a huge part of the world’s future.“The challenge as I see it is that it is almost impossible for incumbent companies to change their business models” said Bruce Usher a professor at Columbia University’s business school who uses Netflix as a case study in his classes. Netflix is one of the very few cases of a firm “radically changing its business model and going on to even greater success” he said.“I can’t think of a company like that in the energy business” Usher said.BP is giving it a try. On Thursday the London-based oil giant said it would spend $1.1 billion for a half ownership in Equinor’s wind projects off the shores of Massachusetts and New York with the hope that the partnership will build more offshore wind projects in a global market expected to grow from 30 gigawatts now to more than 200 gigawatts by the end of the decade.BP is adding this to a portfolio that includes a 50 percent ownership stake in European solar company Lightsource BP which is developing projects.It’s just a start. The oil and gas company’s chief executive Bernard Looney a drilling and production engineer said on Aug. 4 that it aims to boost spending on low carbon projects from $500 million a year to $5 billion a year by the end of the decade. Even that larger figure however would be barely 40 percent of BP’s overall capital spending budget.The company has also said it would consider installing electric vehicle recharging stations at many of the more than 7000 retail gasoline stations in the United States. The company has already purchased Britain’s largest electric vehicle charging network and another network in China. And it plans to help cities and utilities buy packages of renewable energy and storage.The need for a far-reaching corporate makeover as the planet warms is pressing the company said. “There’s a fundamental belief about our business proposition: that the world actually demands more affordable clean energy” said Dev Sanyal chief executive of BP’s alternative energy business and a member of the company’s executive leadership team. “Providing the energy the world needs the way that it wants it — that is a shift in our strategy.”After years of trying to impress investors by building bigger oil and gas reserves BP earlier this year said it would stop looking for oil and gas in new areas and would slash oil and gas output by 40 percent. Last quarter it also sharply wrote down the value of its oil and gas reserves.The new strategy might be good for the world but tough on the company in the short run.Sanyal said that BP expects returns on renewable investments in the range of 8 to 10 percent — a solid stable performance but perhaps falling short of the oil industry’s traditional returns. BP recently cut its dividend and Royal Dutch Shell slashed its dividend for the first time since World War II a blow for shareholders especially British pension systems that rely heavily on Big Oil’s checks.“We’re not promising the world. We’re promising 8 to 10 percent” Looney said in answering questions from stock analysts on Monday.“You have to continue to take care of the core business to generate the cash to fund the transition and keep the investors on board as you slowly shift away from higher-margin projects to lower-margin energy projects” said a mid-level executive who was not authorized to speak for the company. “I don’t envy the job of a CEO of an oil company. It’s a really hard task.”He said that there wasn’t much choice though given shareholder activism and political pressure for fossil fuel companies to abide by guidelines in the Paris climate accord. The alternative was to wait for big financial shareholders to divest or vote you out of business or for the company to get “regulated out of business” because of climate change he said.The other challenge that BP faces as it tries to reinvent itself is competition in areas where other companies have more experience.One competitor is 8minute Solar Energy a privately owned firm that is building solar panels expected to generate 18 gigawatts — enough to provide power to 20 million people. (Eight minutes is the time it takes for solar radiation to travel from the sun to Earth.)The company has more than 50 utility-scale projects under construction including a $1.3 billion installation for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power that generates solar energy and then stores it. The projects rely on power purchase agreements where the developer owns the solar panels and keeps a percentage of the payments for the electricity produced.BP’s Looney said that the Lightsource solar unit has gone from 1.6 gigawatts under construction to 16 gigawatts in just two years. Looney’s goal is 50 gigawatts.“As a climate activist I say [BP’s overhaul] sounds great” said Tom Buttgenbach chief executive of 8minute Solar. “The problem the oil majors have as businesses is they’re so damn big. To invest a little in renewables isn’t going to help.”Usher the Columbia professor agreed.“The key challenge for BP and other oil & gas companies isn’t just that these (renewable energy) business areas are less sexy but that they are relatively simple businesses with low barriers to entry and therefore low profitability” Usher said in an email. Compared to oil and gas drilling Usher said “running a solar or wind farm isn’t very complex or difficult.”As a result he expects big oil companies to “gravitate towards the more challenging projects” which include offshore wind where their experience with drilling platforms would help. They could also take on very large projects in challenging countries such as in sub-Saharan Africa where major oil companies already have experience he said.In the end BP — which has searched for gas and oil reserves in far-flung places such as Iraq the Caspian Sea Russia the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska — could end up looking like an electric utility albeit one that will be good for the climate.The reason? Fighting climate will require a massive infusion of capital for a shift toward electrification. The International Energy Agency has calculated that reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 requires taking the equivalent of the largest solar park in the world and building a new one every two days. Or it could mean building the equivalent of the massive Northern Lights carbon capture project every week.Oil and gas is one of the few industries able to make those massive investments. A Goldman Sachs report says that capital spending on low carbon projects by Europe’s big oil companies — BP Total Shell ENI Equinor and Repsol — would surpass $170 billion by 2030. While ExxonMobil and Chevron have devoted only modest resources to low carbon projects other smaller companies have made the switch already. Orsted once a Danish coal company has become one of the world’s leading installers of wind turbines.Companies have done the easy part — changing their names. BP used to be known as British Petroleum. The Norwegian state-owned Equinor was formerly known as Statoil. Orsted was previously Danish Oil and Natural Gas or DONG.“If a company is to succeed over time it must change and adapt at least as fast as its surroundings” Equinor says on its website. It said the name change meant it was “going from being a pure oil and gas company to become a broad energy major.”But that might not be enough. Most companies facing disruptive technology go the way of Smith Corona the once-dominant typewriter maker that couldn’t match the competition from personal computers and filed for bankruptcy in 1995.BP’s annual outlook paper puts forward three widely divergent scenarios for oil and gas consumption. Looney says in the report that “the world is on an unsustainable path and its carbon budget is running out.”Getting off that path will be difficult. The report politely adds that “a rapid and sustained fall in carbon emissions is likely to require a series of policy measures led by a significant increase in carbon prices” — something American lawmakers have been averse to doing. Without tax-driven increases in carbon prices oil and gas use will continue to rise the report said. But “delaying these policies … may lead to significant economic costs and disruption” the company said.“In terms of an oil company saying it will no longer emit carbon dioxide when that’s what fossil fuels are it’s a radical change for a company BP’s size” Usher said. “If it is successful in this it will be extraordinarily impactful. But from a business management perspective this is going to be very hard.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2020/09/15/bp-climate-change-transition/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Opinion | The military is providing an unexpected and powerful line of defense against Russian interference,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-military-is-providing-an-unexpected-and-powerful-line-of-defense-against-russian-interference/2020/09/15/6fafbb86-f779-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
But there’s a backstop: The U.S. Cyber Command is quietly pushing ahead with the effort it began two years ago to “defend forward” against Russian influence operations — which means getting inside Russian cybernetworks to detect and disrupt attacks.Cyber Command’s operations against Russia in recent months have been “very aggressive and very effective” said one defense official — to the point that they’ve disoriented some Russian operations planners. Thanks to these efforts it will be “virtually impossible” for the Russians or anyone else to penetrate voting systems in the roughly 8000 jurisdictions around the country the defense official said.When it comes to the Russian election threat Washington is a tale of two cities. Military commanders are doing their jobs independently and professionally. Political appointees in civilian agencies appear to be more susceptible to White House pressure. For a vivid illustration of the difference compare two documents that emerged over the past month.First take a look at the article published in Foreign Affairs on Aug. 25 by Gen. Paul M. Nakasone the Cyber Command chief and Michael Sulmeyer his senior adviser. They wrote that Cyber Command has expanded the “hunt forward” strategy that “disrupted a concerted effort to undermine the midterm elections” in 2018. They pledged: “Together with its partners Cyber Command is doing all of this and more for the 2020 elections.”Nakasone bluntly told a House committee in March that Russia’s “willingness to launch destructive cyber operations and pervasive influence campaigns . . . remains the top concern when it comes to the 2020 elections.”Measuring Cyber Command’s success is impossible. We don’t know what the Russians or others are planning this year or whether they’ve been deterred. But the public commitment by Nakasone who has strong backing from Gen. Mark A. Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should give the public some confidence in the integrity of our election system. In the end this public trust is the key ingredient.Now look at a second document disclosed Sept. 8 by the House Intelligence Committee about alleged political interference at DHS. It’s a whistleblower complaint from Brian Murphy the DHS official who oversaw intelligence and analysis until he was fired in August. In the blur of news this month Murphy’s complaint hasn’t received the attention it deserves.Murphy charged that in mid-May this year DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf instructed him “to cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran.” When Murphy protested to his superiors Wolf reiterated on July 8 that the intelligence about Russia should be “held” because it “made the President look bad” according to the complaint.Murphy was dumped after allegations that DHS had improperly gathered information about peaceful protesters in Portland Ore. and elsewhere. But his complaint suggests that he was a political fall guy. Murphy said in the complaint that he wasn’t aware of any such surveillance actions and that he would have refused to authorize them — but that Wolf told him his reassignment “would be politically good for Mr. Wolf.”Wolf has rejected the whistleblower’s allegations. “We’ve been very clear about making sure that we call out Russia” he told Fox News. It’s true that DHS has maintained a strong election security program — supervised by Christopher C. Krebs head of its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency — which maintains close contact with Cyber Command. But Wolf’s behavior undermines confidence in DHS’s political independence.Trump’s campaign of denial on Russian activities has been relentless. He fired Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and his successor Joseph Maguire. His appointees sought to prevent intelligence agencies from providing public briefings about Russian meddling. It’s unnerving that Trump remains so protective of the Kremlin to this day.With fewer than 50 days until the election what safeguard does America have against foreign adversaries who would exploit our current divisions? The best protection is a responsible electorate. But it’s reassuring that our military — which swears its oath to the Constitution not to any individual — has our backs.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-military-is-providing-an-unexpected-and-powerful-line-of-defense-against-russian-interference/2020/09/15/6fafbb86-f779-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Jon Stewart urges health-care law for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/09/15/jon-stewart-burn-pits-veterans/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The wars in Afghanistan Iraq and elsewhere generated enormous amounts of waste including vehicle parts lithium-ion batteries solvents amputated limbs. U.S. contractors soaked the items in jet fuel and set them ablaze in hundreds of open-air burn pits some larger than a football field. Veterans advocates say service members exposed to the pits developed cancer and respiratory illnesses but the U.S. government has said the toxic substances are not conclusively linked to severe health conditions.In an address at the U.S. Capitol Stewart blasted lawmakers for not granting broad care and benefits to veterans sickened by burn pits and said the U.S. government has failed service members by setting an “almost impossibly high bar” to prove they were exposed to toxins.“War after war after war we treat them as expendable. And when they come home we’re done with them” Stewart said later Tuesday in an interview with The Washington Post. “If an enemy did this to us we’d … bomb them into oblivion. We did it to ourselves and we’re ignoring it.”As many as 3.5 million service members were exposed to burn pits and toxic chemicals during the first Gulf War through the global war on terrorism said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) who proposed the legislation with Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.). The measure would grant presumption of exposure to veterans with certain conditions and who served in one of 33 countries where troops were deployed after the 9/11 attacks Gillibrand said.That would reduce the burden of evidence they must currently provide she said such as exposure to specific burn pits and authoritative links to illnesses. That high bar has led to many denials of claims and care according to Gillibrand and advocates.VA has maintained there is not enough scientific evidence to conclusively link exposure and chronic health problems and evaluates claims on an individual basis.Danielle Robinson said her husband Heath Robinson developed stage-4 lung cancer after serving with the Ohio National Guard in Iraq where he lived near burn pits. Doctors said his condition was consistent with toxic exposure Robinson told reporters. He died in May.“My husband is dead because America poisoned its soldiers” Robinson said.Gillibrand told The Post she and other advocates have tried for years to broaden the scope of benefits and care for sickened veterans contending with other lawmakers and VA.“We’ve tried everything else” Gillibrand said. But the plight of New York first responders she said provided a helpful road map.“We did the epidemiology studies. We know the toxins created on 9/11 were the same at these burn pits” she said.The fight for presuming illnesses related to exposure is similar to the plight of Vietnam veterans who for decades were denied care for exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange. VA now presumes certain conditions are related to exposure based on deployment history rather than relying on the veteran to prove they encountered the chemical at a certain place.VA spokeswoman Christina Noel said eligibility requirements for VA health care and disability compensation are set by Congress. VA monitors the latest research on burn pits she said including a National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine study issued Friday.None of 27 severe illnesses met sufficient criteria to be linked to toxic exposure the report found and other conditions such as chronic persistent cough shortness of breath and wheezing had limited or suggestive links.Noel said the study found “insufficient evidence” linking respiratory illnesses and combat deployments. The report authors cautioned against such an interpretation saying incomplete data prevented researchers from drawing definitive conclusions.A tiny number of compensation claims filed since 2007 — more than 14000 out of nearly 16 million — are related to burn pits Noel said. She did not say how many of those were denied.VA could serve a more proactive role as a veterans health advocate Stewart said. “But VA is being purposefully obtuse and they’re purposely misdirecting people as a way of avoiding responsibility … they put veterans on almost a literal trial.”VA opened a burn pit registry for veterans to document health concerns and recently noted the 200000th registrant — a fraction of the overall number that may have been exposed.“It is past time that veterans exposed to these deadly toxins receive the benefits that they deserve” said Jeremy Butler the chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America an advocacy group that joined other veterans groups in endorsing the proposed bill.In Iraq one notoriously large pit in Balad burned continuously for years at one point incinerating 147 tons of waste per day Military Times reported.Military officials including an Air Force bioenvironmental engineer in 2006 cautioned that the Balad burn pit posed acute and chronic health risks Military Times reported.Stewart who was also a fierce proponent of extending the health fund for Sept. 11 first responders said the items burned at Balad and elsewhere included the remnants of firearms.“The smoking gun” Stewart said “is literally smoking guns.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/09/15/jon-stewart-burn-pits-veterans/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Top Trump health appointee Michael Caputo warns of armed insurrection after election,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/14/michael-caputo-coronavirus-cdc/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“Since joining the administration my family and I have been continually threatened and in and out of criminal court dealing with harassment prosecutions” Caputo said in a statement. “This weighs heavily on us and we deeply appreciate the friendship and support of President Trump as we address these matters and keep our children safe.”Caputo’s comments come as Trump administration officials say they are seeking to build public support for a coronavirus vaccine but have faced a series of disappointing setbacks most recently the release of audio in which the president admitted that he deliberately downplayed the virus when he knew it was “deadly.”Trump installed Caputo in April after weighing whether to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar over a series of damaging stories about Trump’s handling of the pandemic according to three current and former White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe behind-the-scenes discussions. Allies persuaded Trump to not make such a change amid a pandemic but instead to bring in Caputo the officials said. (Trump denied reports that he was considering firing Azar at the time.)Almost immediately Caputo began exerting control over officials’ public appearances and statements; by early summer he had extended that scrutiny to scientists. He and an adviser have faced mounting criticism in recent days for interfering with the work of scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention seeking to change delay or kill weekly scientific reports they thought undermined Trump’s message that the pandemic is under control. Caputo has also sought to wield influence over when government scientists appear on television telling officials that he approves such bookings.Caputo is viewed as a Trump loyalist but several White House officials said his behavior has been erratic and some of his ideas have been regarded as extreme. For example he proposed the federal government spend millions of dollars on a professionally directed and produced documentary about the administration’s race to develop vaccines that he wanted to air at film festivals said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The idea was rejected by White House communications aides.In the Facebook video Caputo criticizes government career scientists the media and Democrats the Times reported and Caputo confirmed. He said he was under attack by the media and that his “mental health has definitely failed."“I don’t like being alone in Washington” Caputo said in the video describing “shadows on the ceiling in my apartment there alone shadows are so long.”Caputo also said the CDC which is part of HHS had a “resistance unit” that aimed to undermine Trump. Without offering any evidence he also accused scientists “deep in the bowels of the CDC” of giving up on science and becoming “political animals.”They “haven’t gotten out of their sweatpants except for meetings at coffee shops” to plot “how they’re going to attack Donald Trump next” he said in the video. “There are scientists who work for this government who do not want America to get well not until after Joe Biden is president.”He also predicted that Trump would win the election but that Biden the Democratic presidential nominee would refuse to concede. “And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration the shooting will begin” he warned in the video. “The drills that you’ve seen are nothing. If you carry guns buy ammunition ladies and gentlemen because it’s going to be hard to get.”Several Democratic lawmakers including Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) called late Monday for Caputo’s firing.“Secretary Azar has a basic responsibility to ensure our public health experts are able to do their jobs our covid-19 response is not undermined by misinformation or conspiracy theories and the data used to inform our efforts is free of political interference” Murray said in a statement.Noting that Caputo has said the president asked him to oversee a $250 million campaign “intended to help America to get back to normal” DeLauro said “We now know this is a propaganda campaign that must be defunded immediately. It is not the mission of the Department of Health and Human Services to get the President reelected.”House Democrats on the select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis also announced that they had launched an investigation into political interference in the CDC’s science reports on the pandemic.The White House declined to comment on the controversy Monday.Speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes conversations a White House official said the president was aware of Caputo’s comments but that his job appeared to be safe for now. Nonetheless the official said some advisers were arguing Caputo should be demoted or removed because of concern that he could damage the administration’s efforts to build public confidence in a prospective coronavirus vaccine.The official said the White House has also recently expanded its coronavirus vaccine messaging team detailing staffers from other agencies in an “end run” around Caputo.Senior White House aides have previously warned Caputo that some of his public comments crossed a line. Caputo deactivated his personal Twitter and Facebook accounts on Monday.HHS released a statement describing Caputo as “a critical integral part of the President’s coronavirus response leading on public messaging as Americans need public health information to defeat the covid-19 pandemic.”Several current and former administration officials have expressed frustration that Caputo seems more focused on the president’s political fortunes than on combating the pandemic. Caputo denied that saying that while he cares about the president’s electoral prospects he is most worried about the deaths and suffering caused by the pandemic. He noted he has urged friends to wear masks. “If you don’t wear a mask you’re part of the problem” he said in the interview.As a former radio talk show host Caputo said he used to host such Facebook Live events every Sunday until he took the assistant secretary job in April. Since then he has done two or three such events to talk about the pandemic response.He said he spoke about being in personal danger on the Facebook Live video because a car had stopped in front of his Buffalo-area home where he was shooting the video and a man rolled the car window down and twice yelled profanities and threatened his life.Since Caputo has been in the HHS job he said his two young daughters now 6 and 8 have been harassed constantly. One man is being prosecuted for yelling profanities at them when they were playing outside he said. The Post could not immediately confirm that case.During the video Caputo said questioners asked whether he would stay in the job because of mounting criticism of his team’s interference in the work of CDC’s weekly scientific missives aimed at the nation’s doctors known as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports. He said he expected to remain in his post.Caputo was an unusual choice for the top health communications job in the government especially in the middle of the worst public health crisis in a century. A New York public relations specialist and political consultant Caputo served as campaign manager to controversial businessman Carl Paladino in his unsuccessful bid for governor of New York in 2010. Caputo began working with Trump in 2014 first to assist Trump’s unsuccessful bid to buy the Buffalo Bills that year and then in 2016 to assist Trump’s efforts in the Republican primary for president in New York.Caputo remained in the public eye particularly after the appointment of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III in 2017. In frequent interviews Caputo bemoaned the investigation and the effect it had on Trump allies who faced hefty legal bills as they received subpoenas and requests for interviews with investigators. When the investigation wrapped Trump hosted Caputo for a meeting in the Oval Office and took pictures with his family.Caputo himself drew the attention of Mueller’s investigators in part because he had had contact with a Russian who offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign.In May 2016 Caputo said a Russian man approached his then-business partner Sergey “George” Petrushin at an art gallery opening in Florida claiming to have information that could be helpful to Trump’s campaign. Petrushin connected him with Caputo who arranged for him to meet with political operative Roger Stone a longtime friend.According to the Mueller report which described the episode investigators found no link between the Russian man’s outreach and the broader effort by Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.As a political adviser and public relations specialist Caputo also had lived for a time in Moscow in the 1990s where he worked on a campaign reminiscent of “Rock the Vote” on behalf of then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin.Returning to the United States Caputo took a contract in 2000 working for the Russian conglomerate Gazprom Media to improve Vladimir Putin’s image in the United States. He later told the Buffalo News that he was “not proud of the work” adding “at the time Putin wasn’t such a bad guy.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/14/michael-caputo-coronavirus-cdc/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Analysis | Trump confirms he wanted to assassinate Assad. In 2018, he denied it was even considered.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/15/trump-confirms-he-wanted-assassinate-assad-2018-he-denied-it-was-even-considered/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
In the Fox interview Trump criticized former defense secretary Jim Mattis who has in recent months warned the country strongly against reelecting Trump. But in the course of making that case Trump offered an odd claim: He said Mattis had effectively stood in the way of his efforts to assassinate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.“I would’ve rather taken him out” Trump said. “I had him all set. Mattis didn’t want to do it. Mattis was a highly overrated general.”When asked whether he regretted not taking Assad out Trump added: “No I don’t regret that. … I had a shot to take him out if I wanted. Mattis was against it.”The first problem with this argument is that Trump is disparaging Mattis for opposing something that Trump doesn’t even say he regrets. The second is that the commander in chief makes these decisions full stop. If Trump wanted to do it Mattis couldn’t block him. The fact that Mattis expressed opposition to a plan that Trump even today doesn’t necessarily advocate may not be the best example of him being a bad public servant.But perhaps the biggest problem is that in the course of making this strange argument Trump directly contradicted himself. The contradiction dates back as it happens to the last time Woodward published a book about him.In 2018 Woodward published “Fear.” In the book he reported Trump had considered assassinating Assad.After Assad launched a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017 Trump called Mattis and said he wanted to assassinate the dictator. “Let’s fucking kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the fucking lot of them” Trump said according to Woodward.“I heard somewhere where they said the assassination of President Assad by the United States. Never even discussed” Trump said adding: “No that was never even contemplated nor would it be contemplated.”He even held it up as evidence that the book shouldn’t have been published.“It should not have been written about in the book” Trump said. “It’s just more fiction. The book is total fiction. Okay?”Trump is now confirming what he claimed was “fiction” was actually very accurate. But as is often the case with Trump it’s still not clear what is the truth.Trump in 2018 after all wasn’t the only one offering something amounting to a denial. So too did then-United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.“I have the pleasure of being privy to those conversations … and I have not once heard the president talk about assassinating Assad” Haley said at the time.It’s theoretically possible such discussions occurred after the September 2018 denials but Mattis resigned in December of that year. In the intervening three months there were no new chemical weapons attacks by the Assad government. Trump was also moving to withdraw from Syria at this time — a decision that led to Mattis’s resignation.The White House had good reason to deny such plans in 2018. Even planning such an operation as a contingency would be highly questionable given its impact in a volatile region — a fact that reinforces the dicey nature of what Trump decided to confirm Tuesday morning. But after all that went into Trump’s denial we just needed Woodward to publish another book for Trump to give an entirely different version of events.It sure undermines Trump’s efforts to cast Woodward as the one who can’t be trusted.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/15/trump-confirms-he-wanted-assassinate-assad-2018-he-denied-it-was-even-considered/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Hurricane Sally sits in the Gulf, but along the coast deadly flood waters are rising.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/09/15/hurricane-sally-biloxi-mobile-floods/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
But it meant as much as 30 inches of rain could fall along the coasts of those states and up to five feet of storm surge could inundate coastal communities. Forecasters said there could be record flooding along rivers in Northwest Florida parts of Alabama and perhaps Georgia.“The slow forward speed is likely to result in a historical rainfall event for the north-central Gulf Coast” the National Hurricane Center posted in an online discussion about the storm Tuesday.Sally’s wobbly movement also makes it hard to predict where it will strike land. On Monday meteorologists predicted it would hit Biloxi Miss. but that changed Tuesday and Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich was relieved.“We’re real thankful that we were spared the storm surge” Gilich said. “Four to six feet they’re predicting. That’s a lot better than seven or 11.”But in Mobile Ala. County Commissioner Merceria Ludgood watched with dread as predictions pointed their way.“We’re telling people that there’s going to be a lot of water” Ludgood said from an emergency management facility where she and other officials planned to ride out the storm. “The ground can only hold so much of it. Don’t wait to leave.”Mobile is a city with thousands of oak trees that could tumble when their root systems are soaked. It is also adorned with rivers canals and the enormous Big Creek Lake that is prone to flooding said Mike Evans deputy director of the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency.Evans said the county has been divided into evacuation zones. Residents south of Interstate 10 as well as those east of Interstate 65 in Mobile Bay and the network of rivers that feed it should get out he said.The county sheriff commissioned a 15-ton military grade vehicle to respond if residents who decide to hunker down are trapped. But Evans hopes it doesn’t come to that. When the hurricane hits public officials emergency personnel included planned to shelter in place.Emergency officials gently asked Mobile County residents to impose on friends and family inland to put them up for a while. Theodore High School where the county established a shelter can usually hold up to a thousand evacuees. But social distancing as a result of the coronavirus pandemic has limited occupation to only 300.Downtown Mobile was mostly empty Tuesday with businesses in the flood-prone area closed in advance of Hurricane Sally. Signs of a hurricane’s approach were a common sight: boarded windows sandbagged doors and streets barricaded in places where water was expected to surge.Hayley’s Bar was one of a few exceptions. Doors were open and three customers enjoyed afternoon drinks. None seemed concerned about the coming storm.“The city floods on like a normal rainy day” said Grace Foster 23. “Here we have rain tropical storms hurricanes. We’re kind of due for a good hurricane.”Foster and the other patrons live within walking distance of Hayley’s. They said they were ready for whatever Sally might bring.“We are all stocked up for covid already so we had a lot of the stuff we need” said Tres Wiggins 28.“I just moved all my plants inside” Foster said “and we stocked up on alcohol.”Heading south toward Dauphin Island Ala. Sally’s effects were more visible Tuesday as floodwaters from Mobile Bay began spilling across roads.Sonya Gunderson 60 was having a ball at a retreat on the island where she traveled from Iowa to meet seven friends who fished the ocean and frolicked on the beach.But Sally chased them off the vulnerable strip of land into a condo in Mobile.On Tuesday she walked in a steady downpour downtown wearing a blue raincoat and carrying a pan a lighter and some candles — supplies borrowed from the property manager in advance of the storm’s impact.“All of our events are canceled” Gunderson said. “We had deep sea fishing dinner on the ocean. Now we’re just playing games.”At a popular fishing spot near Buccaneer Yacht Club Robert Boykin 62 sat with his wife in one of a dozen parked cars looking out over the bay’s unusually choppy waters.“I just hope it doesn’t get too bad because I only stay a mile or two from here” Boykin said.For Boykin and others Sally’s snail-paced approach made it hard to know just when to hunker down.“We’re here looking now” he said. “But as soon as we get home we’re going to be there.”In Biloxi the city’s eight casinos were still temporarily shut after the storm turned east. One casino flashed a sign saying “Sorry.”Since 2005 residents have compared major storms to Hurricane Katrina which pummeled the city with 28 feet of storm surges that are still marked in blue paint on telephone poles.“We got wiped off the face of the Earth” said Karen Parrott 63 as she took an afternoon stroll to the shore with her husband Bill also 63.The couple said they were not worried about Hurricane Sally.“Not after Katrina” she said.Across the Route 110 bridge that links Biloxi to the city of D’Iberville Miss. a pair of friends chatted as the high tide covered picnic tables and seeped into the road. They said they were not expecting much from Sally.“It’s doubtful this late in the season” said Joshua Jackson 27 a construction worker from the community of Vancleave Miss. who stopped to hang out under the bridge on his way home from work in Gulfport Miss.But the Biloxi mayor — a lifelong resident — said he was not prepared to declare storm season over.“Who knows?” Gilich said about it noting that in his State of the City address in January he had predicted a great year ahead. “Don’t you just feel really good about 2020?” he recalled saying in his speech.“Boy was I wrong” he said with an eye roll. “I’m not going to say that again."In Northwest Florida Escambia and Santa Rosa county officials imposed voluntary evacuation orders for coastal and low-lying areas urging vulnerable residents to seek higher ground.“Flooding is one of the most serious concerns we have with this storm” Escambia County Emergency Manager Eric Gilmore said during a Tuesday afternoon news conference. “The amount of rain and storm surge will make this a historic event."The brand-new Pensacola Bay Bridge one of only two evacuation routes off Santa Rosa Island and Pensacola Beach was shut down Tuesday when a barge operated by a state contractor collided with the structure.Local officials suspended tolls for the nearby Garcon Point Bridge to make it easier for residents to evacuate.On the other side of Escambia Bay in downtown Pensacola about 100 residents had hunkered down at a local civic center turned storm shelter by midafternoon.Michael Kimberl director of the Alfred Washburn Center which serves the homeless spent much of the last 24 hours ferrying the homeless to the civic center.“I’ve been driving shuttle most of the afternoon and last night trying to get people to shelters” said Kimberl who dropped off about 30 people there by 3 p.m. Tuesday.Kimberl worried he wouldn’t be able to reach all of the area’s homeless before the storm made landfall and felt local authorities were partially to blame for waiting too long to announce local shelter openings.“We had about 100 people at the center yesterday afternoon” he said. “Had I known about the shelter before we closed I could have sent them there.”Cusick reported from Mobile Sacchetti reported from Biloxi Strickland reported from Pensacola and Fears reported from D.C.

Opinion | I directed ‘Cuties.’ This is what you need to know about modern girlhood.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cuties-director-maimouna-doucoure-why-i-made-the-film/2020/09/15/7e0ee406-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The result was my movie "Mignonnes" or "Cuties" in English. I wanted to make a film in the hope of starting a conversation about the sexualization of children. The movie has certainly started a debate though not the one that I intended.Puberty is such a confusing time. You are still a child with all that wonderful naivete and innocence but your body is changing and you're self-conscious and curious about its impact on others all at the same time.The stories that the girls I spoke to shared with me were remarkably similar. They saw that the sexier a woman is on Instagram or TikTok the more likes she gets. They tried to imitate that sexuality in the belief that it would make them more popular. Spend an hour on social media and you'll see preteens — often in makeup — pouting their lips and strutting their stuff as if they were grown women. The problem of course is that they are not women and they don't realize what they are doing. They construct their self-esteem based on social media likes and the number of followers they have.To see these youngsters put so much pressure on themselves so early was heartbreaking. Their insights and experiences with social media informed "Cuties."The main character in the film is an 11-year-old girl called Amy whose family like mine came from Senegal and lives in Paris. Frustrated by her mother's failure to take control of her own life Amy decides to seek freedom by joining a clique of girls at school who are preparing to enter a local dance contest and design increasingly risque routines copying what they've seen on their phones. The girls don't have the maturity however to realize what their gestures and dance moves look like to the audience. It is only in seeing the shock on parents' faces in the audience and at the same time thinking of what her mother is going through that Amy realizes that these dance routines bring no freedom at all. She chooses her own path balancing her family's traditional roots and the more liberal city in which she lives.Some people have found certain scenes in my film uncomfortable to watch. But if one really listens to 11-year-old girls their lives are uncomfortable.We as adults have not given children the tools to grow up healthy in our society. I wanted to open people's eyes to what's truly happening in schools and on social media forcing them to confront images of young girls made up dressed up and dancing suggestively to imitate their favorite pop icon. I wanted adults to spend 96 minutes seeing the world through the eyes of an 11-year-old girl as she lives 24 hours a day. These scenes can be hard to watch but are no less true as a result. Like most 11- and 12-year-olds our actors in the film had already seen these types of dances and more. Despite this during filming we were extremely mindful of their age. A trained counselor was present on set. There was no nudity except for a one-second shot in which the main characters see the exposed breast of an actress over 18 while watching a video of a dance routine on a grainy mobile screen. The project was even approved by the French government's child protection authorities.This film is my own story. All my life I have juggled two cultures: Senegalese and French. As a result people often ask me about the oppression of women in more traditional societies. And I always ask: But isn't the objectification of women's bodies in Western Europe and the United States another kind of oppression? When girls feel so judged at such a young age how much freedom will they ever truly have in life?And that's why I made "Cuties": to start a debate about the sexualization of children in society today so that maybe — just maybe — politicians artists parents and educators could work together to make a change that will benefit children for generations to come. It's my sincerest hope that this conversation doesn't become so difficult that it too gets caught up in today's "cancel culture.",body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cuties-director-maimouna-doucoure-why-i-made-the-film/2020/09/15/7e0ee406-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Analysis | Andrew Gillum comes back to public life, starting with coming out as bisexual,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/15/lgbt-leaders-hope-more-bisexuals-enter-politics-after-andrew-gillum-comes-out/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Gillum came out as bisexual Monday during his first sit-down interview since March when police found him inebriated and unconscious in a South Beach Miami hotel room with two men. (Drugs were found at the scene though Gillum denies he used illegal substances and was not arrested.) That incident prompted Gillum to seek treatment and generated speculation that the former Tallahassee mayor and married father of three was gay.The scandal seemed like it could be a sad crescendo to the promising political career of a man who came within a percentage point of being Florida’s first Black governor in 2018. And it is anything but clear what his path forward as a politician may be. But it’s significant that Gillum saw coming out so publicly as valuable.“To be very honest with you when you didn’t ask the question you put it out there is whether or not I identify as gay” he said to talk show host Tamron Hall. “And the answer is I don’t identify as gay but I do identify as bisexual. And that is something that I have never shared publicly before.”“The truth is is that Tamron everyone believes the absolute worst about that day” Gillum added. “At this stage I don’t have anything else to have to conceal.”That transparency — especially in politics — is uncommon and could make it a bit easier for bisexual Americans hoping to enter the political sphere said Alphonso David president of the Human Rights Campaign one of the largest LGBT rights groups in America.“In coming out as bisexual — and coming out publicly — Andrew Gillum has perhaps made it easier for other Black bi-plus people to come out themselves” said David. “Coming out is a deeply personal decision and is one that looks different for each individual. But regardless of the circumstances anyone who comes out deserves respect and openness.”And David Johns executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition a Black LGBT civil rights organization called Gillum’s experience coming to terms with his own sexuality relatable for many queer Black Americans.“Black members of the LGBTQ+ community across the country watched Andrew Gillum’s interview with Tamron Hall today with empathy and love as so many of us can relate to the complex issues and feelings he conveyed” he said. “When we are forced by harmful societal expectations to operate in black and white with no room to express the many gray areas of ourselves that make us who we are we get hurt.”Among the conversations that have swept the country this past summer about racism in America were discussions about homophobia within the Black community and racism within the LGBT community. Gillum’s interview showcased a Black man in the LGBT community embracing and discussing his identities and how he and those close to them are attempting to understand them better and how they shape his worldview including his politics.Katie Hill who was California’s first openly bisexual person elected to Congress before conservative media outlets published nude photos suggesting an alleged affair between the lawmaker and a staffer praised Gillum and his wife for their decision to go public with the former Tallahassee mayor’s sexuality.“We found that voters still penalize candidates for being gay or lesbian” he wrote.Much ignorance and stigma still exist about bisexuality said R. Jai Gillum Andrew’s wife. And it is not uncommon for people struggling to understand and accept their sexual identity to succumb to depression and substance abuse according to American Addiction Centers one of the country’s largest providers of addiction services.“So many people just don’t understand bisexuality” R. Jai Gillum told Hall. “Bisexuality is just something different. I just believe that love and sexuality exist on a spectrum. All I care about is what’s between us and what agreement we make.”As some Americans look to political leaders to better reflect the diversity of the population that they represent that will include a push to see people of varied sexual orientations — including bisexuality — in Washington and state capitals around the country. The details of Gillum’s coming out could present challenges for him among a voting population uncomfortable with backing queer politicians but he made it clear that he doesn’t think his sexuality or past will make doing so impossible.When asked whether he could make a return to politics one day Gillum replied: “Donald Trump is president.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/15/lgbt-leaders-hope-more-bisexuals-enter-politics-after-andrew-gillum-comes-out/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Opinion | A Roger Stone protege is interfering in important CDC reports. It’s appalling.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/michael-caputo-cdc-reports-mmwr-interference/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The article was the first case series in the medical literature to describe the syndrome that we now call AIDS. It was extremely important — both clinically in that it alerted doctors to think about Pneumocystis carinii when evaluating pneumonia in men who have sex with men and scientifically in that it spurred researchers to investigate why these otherwise healthy men were suddenly dying.In the early 1980s there was significant stigma attached to homosexuality. President Ronald Reagan had won power in part by mobilizing religious conservatives many of whom were hostile to gay people. But it’s unlikely the MMWR report’s authors were thinking much about politics when they published their findings. If anything they were going against the political headwinds of the moment not bowing to them. They were instead rightly focused on public health.This is characteristic of the MMWR known as a trustworthy scientific publication. Its high standards of evidence and its reliability have made it an important source of data for clinicians and public health researchers for decades.That reputation is now at risk. According to recent news reports the spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services Michael Caputo — a political appointee and protege of Roger Stone who worked as a consultant for President Trump — has tried to force the CDC to delay the MMWRs and coerce the CDC into altering wording on its findings. He has also demanded that the CDC retract published MMWR articles. Caputo’s rationale has been that CDC scientists are part of a “deep state” opposed to Trump’s reelection and that the reports contradict Trump’s statements about covid-19 and make him look bad.Caputo’s manipulation is appalling. If left unchecked it could have disastrous consequences for the reputation and reliability of the CDC which has already been battered by the U.S. response to covid-19. It could also prove devastating for medical practice in the United States more broadly.Physicians need clear scientifically reliable information in order to provide our patients with the best possible medical care and maintain their trust. One of the articles Caputo and his team reportedly delayed concerned children who contracted the coronavirus while at summer camp in Georgia — essential information for pediatricians advising parents on group activities.Another article concerned the lack of benefit of hydroxychloroquine in treating covid-19. Following Trump’s repeated claims that the drug is a promising option for fighting the novel coronavirus many Americans demanded hydroxychloroquine prescriptions and the U.S. government stockpiled 63 million doses. The result was a shortage for people who needed the drug for autoimmune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. There are real-life consequences to these political shenanigans: I recently saw a lupus patient whose inability to refill her hydroxychloroquine prescription led to an emergency-room visit for intractable pain.Caputo’s interference with the MMWR’s covid-19 reporting sets a dangerous precedent for other conditions as well. I frequently consult the MMWR to stay up-to-date on my ongoing research into seafood-related illnesses. What if a future restaurant-industry lobbyist exerts pressure on HHS to suppress unfavorable information about seafood-related outbreaks? If sympathetic political appointees comply the result could be a series of incorrect diagnoses as doctors fail to recognize patients’ symptoms as seafood-related. Others in the seafood industry would be harmed too: Transparency and trust in the CDC’s medical literature allow consumers to feel confident that the fish they eat is safe and that if there is an outbreak they or their doctors will know about it.The same applies to covid-19. At a time when there is so much mistrust of government authorities surrounding the pandemic — when one-third of people surveyed said they would not get a vaccine even if it were made available for free — tainting one of the few remaining credible sources of medical information is a recipe for disaster.Of course no scientist is infallible — which is why the MMWR has a thorough process for vetting its reports. This rigor is one of many reasons that past presidential administrations have remained hands-off with the CDC’s findings. While Reagan has been criticized for acting too slowly to address AIDS his Department of Health and Human Services knew better than to undercut the credibility of the MMWR. Imagine how many more lives would have been needlessly cut short if it hadn’t.Just as doctors in the Reagan era did those of us in the trenches of clinical practice today need assurance that political hacks aren’t meddling with the MMWR’s guidance. If anything that confidence has become all the more essential amid the unfolding disaster of covid-19 — and our government’s ongoing bungled response.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/michael-caputo-cdc-reports-mmwr-interference/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Coronavirus kills far more Hispanic and Black children than White youths, CDC study finds,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/15/covid-deaths-hispanic-black-children/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Of those killed by covid-19 the illness caused by the coronavirus more than 75 percent have been Hispanic Black and American Indian children even though they represent 41 percent of the U.S. population according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal agency collected data from health departments throughout the country.The disproportionate deaths among youths echo pandemic disparities well-documented among adults. Previous studies have found the virus’s death toll is twice as high among people of color under age 65 as for White Americans. People of color also disproportionately make up “excess deaths” — those killed by the virus without being diagnosed or those killed indirectly by the virus’s wide effects on the health-care system.The racial disparities among children are in some ways even more stark.Of the children and teens killed 45 percent were Hispanic 29 Black and 4 percent American Indian.“This is the strongest evidence yet that there are deep racial disparities in children just like there are in adults” said John Williams chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. “What that should mean for people is steps like wearing a mask are not just about protecting your family and yourself. It is about racial equity.”One key factor could be underlying health disparities among minority children and young adults. About 75 percent of those who died had at least one underlying condition and the most frequent were asthma and obesity — two conditions that disproportionately occur in minority youths.“On one hand the small total number of deaths is reassuring. You’re talking about hundreds of thousands of children infected and only 121 killed” said Frank Esper a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic Children’s. “At the same time proportions at which minority groups are dying are hard to ignore.”The CDC report pointed to underlying social disparities that minority children are more likely to experience than their White peers: crowded living conditions food and housing insecurity parents who are essential workers and cannot work from home wealth and education gaps and difficulty accessing health care because of a lack of family resources including insurance child care transportation or sick leave.In the report CDC officials conclude that what’s needed is for health departments medical providers and communities to “mobilize to remove systemic barriers that contribute to health disparities.”In addition to social disparities the racial gap in fatalities suggests genetic or biologic factors could be at play said Williams. Some diseases have been shown to affect certain races more severely. Before a vaccine was developed for example pneumococcal meningitis disproportionately affected Black children Williams said even after accounting for social determinants. Similarly Haemophilus influenzae type b (also known as Hib) was known to disproportionately affect Native Americans.The CDC report emphasized that the relatively low death toll for children was recorded when almost all schools were closed and that it is unknown how the reopening of schools could affect those rates.Tuesday’s CDC report reinforced another prominent characteristic of the virus — that it becomes increasingly lethal with age. Among children only 10 percent of deaths occurred in infants age 1 or younger. Roughly 20 percent of pediatric cases were between ages 1 and 9. The remaining were between ages 10 and 20.Since the virus emerged the way it attacks the elderly and leaves the very young relatively unscathed has been a central and puzzling mystery to scientists. In that regard the novel coronavirus behaves differently from other viruses such as seasonal influenza. Those other viruses are especially dangerous for the very young and very old.Figuring out why children are less affected researchers believed could help them understand how and why the virus sickens and kills other age groups. While there are not yet definitive answers emerging evidence suggests a key protein — called the ACE2 receptor which the coronavirus uses to enter cells — is present in lower amount in the airways of children than in adults.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/15/covid-deaths-hispanic-black-children/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Global views of U.S. plunge to new lows amid pandemic, poll finds,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/15/global-views-united-states-trump-coronavirus-pew-poll/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The data released by Pew Research Center suggests that the international reputation of the United States has dropped to a new low in the face of a disorganized response to the novel coronavirus. The country leads the world in virus-related deaths.International affairs analysts say it may be difficult to repair the damage to the United States’ standing overseas. Among some traditional allies like Germany views of the United States have declined to the lowest levels since Pew began tracking them nearly two decades ago.“I still think there is admiration for the United States but it may be waning very quickly — especially if Trump gets reelected” said Sudha David-Wilp a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.Pew surveyed 13 foreign nations all wealthy democracies along with the United States this summer.After Trump entered office in 2017 Pew found much of the world to hold a negative view of the U.S. leader with views of the United States overall dipping in many nations.But Pew’s latest polling suggests that the pandemic an unprecedented global crisis has caused views of the United States among its closest peers to slide even further.In contrast many respondents had positive perspectives on their own countries: Nearly three-quarters of people polled said their own governments had done a good job handling the crisis.Internationally the U.S. rating was significantly lower than the ratings for the World Health Organization which the Trump administration has dubbed “corrupt” and China the epicenter of the initial outbreak which Trump said “sent us the plague.”In at least seven nations including key allies like Britain and Japan approval ratings for the United States plunged to record lows. In Germany just 26 percent of the respondents held a positive view of the United States — the lowest rating since 2003 the year of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.Among the countries surveyed Belgians had the lowest estimation of the United States: Just 24 percent of Belgians said they had a positive view.Pew has only recorded lower ratings twice: Both times in Spain during the administration of President George W. Bush when 16 and 23 percent of the Spanish population had a favorable view of the United States in 2003 and 2006 respectively.This spring even before the pandemic surged in the United States David-Wilp said German experts and commentators with whom she spoke expressed doubts that the United States would be able to handle the pandemic and feared that serious social unrest would develop.“And lo and behold you did actually see that” she said referring to the high number of deaths in the United States and the protests against racial injustice that have swept the country.Trump has proved consistently unpopular in global polls but the pandemic appears to have worsened his international reputation. Positive ratings of Trump in Japan dropped from 36 percent in spring 2019 to 25 percent this year — still the highest of any nation surveyed.The decline was even more pronounced in South Korea where 46 percent of respondents gave Trump a positive rating in spring 2019 compared with 17 percent this year. South Koreans gave the U.S. handling of the pandemic the worst rating of any nation with 6 percent saying the United States did a good job.South Korea a key U.S. ally tends to see the country in a positive light said Kang Won-taek a professor at Seoul National University. Trump’s outreach to North Korea and interest in the peninsula may have given his popularity a boost among some South Koreans in recent years.“The euphoria is gone” Kang said in an email pointing to a lack of progress in peace talks with Pyongyang and Trump’s heavy-handed approach to relations with Seoul. The U.S. handling of the novel coronavirus had dented the country’s standing with South Koreans he said.“As a matter of fact many Koreans are very surprised that the U.S. has not effectively dealt with the outbreak” Kang said adding that many Koreans pin the blame on what they see as Trump’s unreliability.Other world leaders fared better than Trump on the world stage. Though China is widely criticized for aggressive foreign policy moves and its secrecy during the early days of the pandemic President Xi Jinping has a marginally more positive international reputation than Trump Pew found.Russian President Vladimir Putin widely suspected of backing attempts at electoral interference and the assassination of dissidents also fared better as did British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron.German Chancellor Angela Merkel frequently criticized by Trump in recent years was by far the most popular leader among those surveyed with a median of 76 percent expressing confidence that she will do the right thing in global affairs.The contrast between Merkel’s cautious handling of Germany’s federal system during the pandemic and Trump’s less disciplined approach David-Wilp said heightened many Germans’ awareness of her reputation.“Germans I think have been surprised and maybe secretly proud of Chancellor Merkel” David-Wilp said. “I think she really touched a nerve with the German people in the sense that she was very open and direct and called [the pandemic] what it was: The biggest crisis Germany is facing in the post-war era.”Pew said it gathered its survey data using nationally representative surveys of 13273 adults from June 10 through Aug. 3 with all interviews conducted by phone. The margin of error ranged from 3.1 percentage points in South Korea to 4.2 in Belgium.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/15/global-views-united-states-trump-coronavirus-pew-poll/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Air Force seeks a radical shift in how jets, missiles and satellites are designed,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/air-force-digital-design/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Now Roper wants to make this sort of process a requirement for companies building any of the Air Force’s premier systems in the future. He is hoping to usher in a new era of weapons development in which computer-generated models — owned by the government and enabled by artificial intelligence technology — can test millions of possible designs in a virtual format before ever creating a prototype.In this case the outcome that seemed to impress him the most was the plane’s low price. Boeing’s Arlington-based defense division is known in the aerospace world for underbidding its rivals.“For me the Sputnik moment was looking under the hood at T-7” Roper said. “The airplane came in at a much lower cost than we expected which begs the question: How? That took me on the odyssey of how it was designed and assembled.”What surprised Roper about the design process for the T-7 was the use of what’s known as “digital threading” in which designers created a digital twin for the jet before manufacturing it. Starting in a virtual format means they can modify and test the plane’s systems with various configurations over the course of its design.For Boeing seeing a top Air Force official hold up the T-7 as a model for aircraft design should come as a welcome reprieve at a difficult time. The company’s reputation for sound engineering has been called into question over design flaws in the 737 Max commercial jetliner which went undiscovered until a pair of plane crashes killed 346 people. Boeing’s defense and space division despite problems with the KC-46 tanker and the Starliner capsule has been more stable by comparison.Roper recognized that a mostly digital design process represented a significant departure from the traditional way of doing things.“There is an old adage in defense acquisition called ‘fly before you buy.’ It’s a caution that you ought to build something and test it out before you commit to buying it” Roper said. “Today you can digitally buy and fly before you even commit to buying that first prototype. Let’s do that in the military and then we can design things more frequently.​​”Using a digital thread in the design process allows automated checks to happen in the background as the product is modified essentially ensuring that as different parts of a plane or missile system are designed they all fit together and don’t face integration problems.Roper said that in the past with the manual design of aircraft small differences in parts that don’t fit together well can end up becoming big problems ― like when you are trying to put together a piece of furniture from Ikea and for some reason the holes don’t line up. Even a variance of a thousandth of an inch within a complicated system can create expensive headaches.Mechanics can also learn how to assemble the plane digitally. For the Red Hawk Roper said mechanics were trained in a simulator to build the aircraft before it was ever put together in the real world.“They achieved the same quality on their first airplane that would normally be achieved on the hundredth” Roper said because they came with the experience of having built the plane digitally.Because of the approach Roper said the Air Force has been able to complete assembly and subsequent maintenance of the T-7 in record time which he described as “off the charts not near any other airplane in recorded history.”It remains to be seen whether the T-7 will live up to expectations. It’s possible the low price and faster assembly process could entail trade-offs in other areas.The U.S. Space Force which was created out of the Air Force last year also will apply this method to new system designs including the missile system that will replace the Minuteman III ICBM fleet. Roper said Northrop Grumman created a digital twin and tried out over 6 billion different variants of the new ICBM using artificial intelligence and machine learning to weigh the trade-offs between cost and different possible characteristics.It is also employing it to design a futuristic fighter jet meant to follow current aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter under a program called Next Generation Air Dominance or NGAD. That program has progressed to the point where a physical prototype ― already designed assembled and tested in a virtual system ― has been flown Roper said Tuesday.If this approach is expected to become the norm it will require a significant shift for U.S. weapons makers. An Air Force spokeswoman said the department does not yet have a written policy requiring digital design processes but is working on one. Roper says he considers the new approach to be a mandate for which any exception requires his personal sign-off.This kind of process shift ― particularly the related requirement that the digital technology be fully owned by the government ― could be controversial for large defense companies that prefer to own and profit from the intellectual property underlying their products.Hawk Carlisle a retired Air Force general who now leads the National Defense Industrial Association said a range of proprietary digital engineering efforts are already underway. He added that the defense industry on the whole would do well to transform its development process accordingly. With digital engineering “you can produce an airplane that is much faster has fewer challenges in the manufacturing process and is much more accurate and perfect. This is the way we have to go and it’s about getting speed and capability out to the warfighter quickly” he said.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/air-force-digital-design/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Sean Doolittle is done for the season. But he wants a different ending in Washington.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/sean-doolittle-nationals-future/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Now he disappeared down the tunnel. The reality was that that moment — 9:29 p.m. on Sept. 10 2020 — could have been his last in a Washington Nationals uniform. The weight of it crept up in the coming days after an MRI confirmed he was out for the season. He could hardly move around his D.C. home leaving him to binge-read a mystery novel and think.A four-season run started with a trade Doolittle didn’t want. He’d been a member of the Oakland Athletics organization for a decade. He felt they were on the cusp of contending. Then he took to Washington in ways he didn’t expect. He and his wife Eireann Dolan were married here in 2017. They’ve connected to the community through a number of charity efforts. On the field Doolittle was an all-star in 2018 and a World Series champion in 2019. He also battled injuries and some of the worst innings of his career. Through all of it he grew.And now at the end of a season played through the novel coronavirus pandemic there are two paths for his future: He could leave the Nationals without a proper send-off. Or Doolittle could re-sign with Washington in free agency and continue his rebound next spring.He’s really hoping for the latter.“That would be the best-case scenario” Doolittle told The Post on Monday. “It’s a little bit nerve-racking for sure. Just going through this process I don’t want to like get my hopes up or have favorites or spots like oh man ‘I really hope this works out with this team’ or whatever … what what?”A voice was chiming in from the background.“Eireann is sitting across the table from me and says ‘I want to stay here’ ” Doolittle added with a laugh. “She says: ‘Print it.’ ”Dolan says something else the words a bit muffled and Doolittle again played middle man in his own interview.“On the record. Print it” he repeated. “She’s serious.”Doolittle turns 34 this month. He has never been a free agent or gone through arbitration. He signed a five-year $10.5 million extension with the Athletics in 2014 designed for stability and a steady income. It included two club options — for $6 million in 2019 $6.5 million for 2020 — and the Nationals exercised both. The second made him an integral part of last October’s championship run.But then came the pandemic and Doolittle struggled. He couldn’t throw off a mound during the sport’s four-month shutdown. When it restarted in July his body was fatigued and he developed bad habits in his delivery. He wasn’t pushing off the mound the right way. His fastball velocity sagged before settling into the high 80s and the early results were troubling.The lefty yielded seven hits and five earned runs in the first two weeks of the season. Three of the 18 hitters he faced took him deep. It was “really scary” he says now to feel fine physically and be all but serving batting practice to opponents. So the Nationals put him on the injured list citing right knee fatigue and gave him 13 days in Fredericksburg Va. to reset.“There were weeks there where I thought it was just gone forever” Doolittle recalled. “I was like ‘Uh well I just throw 88 with no life now. I’m going to have to figure out how to get guys out again.’ I thought about learning how to throw a sinker like could I just dive bomb sinkers maybe and be a sinker-curveball guy? If these are my mechanics now for some reason can I use them to create a new version of myself?”It wouldn’t come to that. Doolittle found a fix a tweak to his lower-half mechanics that restored his fastball velocity and movement. The hour-long drives to Fredericksburg straight south down Interstate 95 became something to anticipate. He had long phone conversations with Manager Dave Martinez. He tore through video. He was energized by catches with top pitching prospects whose fastballs stung inside his mitt.In the spring while the pandemic raged when the country erupted with protests after the death of George Floyd who was killed while in police custody Doolittle had wondered how long he would play. He has many interests beyond baseball. He was initially unsure about participating in 2020. He could have finished out his contract and hung it up on his terms. But this season — however frustrating however exacting on his mental health at times — reconnected him with baseball. He says that returning in August pitching four scoreless innings being in the bullpen and clubhouse is some of the most fun he has had. He makes that clear when he explains why he wants to stay in Washington. He first mentions Martinez then the strength and conditioning staff then his teammates then wanting to reward everyone who helped him through the summer. “This just reminded me how much I love it and how I want to continue with baseball as long as it will let me” Doolittle said. “With the quarantine and the negotiations and covid we weren’t sure if we were going to play at all and then I land on the IL and I’m so ineffective that it’s scary. It scared me. Some doubt starts to creep in and then to be able to get it right and come back and have the support of everybody behind you …“I don’t know it was absolutely a roller coaster of emotions. But I’m very grateful for it.”Now comes the hard part — being judged on an uneven performance. Doolittle plans to live wherever he can best rehab his oblique this winter. He wants to send tape and velocity numbers to teams as soon as possible. In a recent news conference Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo wouldn’t discuss Doolittle’s pending free agency. But he did note the reliever’s stark improvements adding that he believes there’s even more in Doolittle’s tank.The first step for Doolittle was believing that himself. The next in a perfect world would be proving it in Washington.“This has been our home for four years” Doolittle said. “This city means so much to us.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/sean-doolittle-nationals-future/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
William Gates Sr., a guiding hand of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, dies at 94,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/william-gates-sr-a-guiding-hand-of-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-dies-at-94/2020/09/15/4715b8c8-9456-11ea-91d7-cf4423d47683_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
He had Alzheimer’s disease his family said in a statement announcing the death.Mr. Gates — 6-foot-6 in tasseled loafers and often addressed as “Senior” — cultivated a self-assured presence that vaulted him to the forefront of his community’s legal and political establishment.To his surprise his son a Microsoft co-founder and Harvard dropout who always seemed to resist parental authority not only surpassed him in wealth and influence but installed him as co-chairman of the family foundation that has become a leader in anti-poverty and global-health initiatives.“I never imagined that the argumentative young boy who grew up in my house eating my food and using my name would be my future employer” Mr. Gates once quipped to a Seattle audience of nonprofit executives.The son of a furniture-store owner the elder Gates was indelibly shaped by his Depression-era upbringing in working-class Bremerton across the Puget Sound from Seattle. His father often brought home stray pieces of coal that had fallen off delivery trucks for use heating their home. After Army service in World War II Mr. Gates attended law school on the G.I. Bill and prospered as a corporate lawyer.He helped build Preston Gates & Ellis — now K&L Gates — into one of Seattle’s premier law firms. As president of county and state bar associations he raised funds for legal aid for the poor. In addition he immersed himself as a trustee officer and volunteer in organizations such as United Way and Planned Parenthood.Of having entered the incendiary realm of reproductive politics he wrote in his book “Showing Up for Life” that “enormous good is achieved when women are empowered and given choices.”By the mid-1990s Bill Sr. was recently widowed and on the cusp of retirement when his son and daughter-in-law asked him to oversee the requests for funding that began pouring into their new family philanthropic organizations. To winnow the deluge of mail Mr. Gates initially relied on a system of cardboard boxes stored in his basement.The Gateses’ various philanthropic endeavors — focusing on health public access to computers and preparing low-income minority students for college — merged into the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000.Its endowment grew into the tens of billions of dollars with businessman Warren Buffett vowing in 2006 to donate the majority of his $44 billion fortune to the foundation and several other philanthropies. Bill Sr. became deeply involved in dispensing hundreds of millions of dollars annually in grants.The needs of the Pacific Northwest consumed much of his focus as the foundation funded regional cultural and educational institutions as well as organizations providing transitional-housing for homeless families.But his long-standing interest in reproductive and children’s health also led to early backing of the New York-based International AIDS Vaccine Initiative the cornerstone of the Gateses’ decades-long investment in efforts to combat the disease.In time he became a roving ambassador for the foundation while chief executive Patty Stonesifer — a former senior Microsoft official with whom he shared the title of co-chairman — focused on management and strategy. She credited Mr. Gates with helping “dramatically scale up” staffing and serving as a “cultural leader” as the organization grew.“He led deeply with this idea that as corny as it sounds to whom much is given much is expected” said Stonesifer who left as CEO in 2008 and later headed the social service organization Martha’s Table in Washington.“He was not without ego — he was a tough lawyer” she added. “But he wasn’t lofty. He never had a sense of entitlement. He was the one who made sure we did everything with head but also heart. He was deeply embedded through his nonprofit work with United Way and Planned Parenthood in what it takes to make a community work. He didn’t think any effort was too small to learn about.”Bill Sr. also helped build the philanthropy’s global profile trekking across sub-Saharan Africa in 2002 alongside former president Jimmy Carter and their wives. They met with government leaders prostitutes and clinic patients to promote condom use and antiretroviral vaccines to prevent the spread of AIDS.Mr. Gates told The Post that he rejected the view of some American donors who declined to support desperately needed charitable work and grant-making in Africa because of endemic corruption on the continent.“I suppose it’s my personal naivete but I would always come out on the side of ‘For God’s sake we’ve got to do something’ rather than say ‘Let’s wait until they fix it’ ” he observed.William Henry Gates II — he called his son “Trey” for third — was born in Bremerton on Nov. 30 1925. As a teenager he was an Eagle Scout the highest rank in the Boy Scouts. After Army service in the Pacific he entered the University of Washington and received a bachelor’s degree in 1949 and a law degree in 1950.The next year he married Mary Maxwell his college sweetheart and they had three children. By his family’s telling he could be emotionally distant but came alive during competitive games from cards to table tennis and dinnertime conversation about world events.“My dad’s a very thoughtful person and things that should be dealt with seriously he deals with seriously and you listen” Bill Jr. told the Seattle Times. “He conveyed somehow without being too explicit his high expectations of us. There was a certain gravitas to his statements.”In a 2009 Wall Street Journal interview Mr. Gates recalled his sometimes contentious relationship with his son whose independent streak made him prone to outbursts against parental control. Bill Sr. once lost his lawyerly cool dousing his boy with a glass of water in an effort to calm him down.“Thanks for the shower” his son replied.Mr. Gates and his wife gradually eased up sending their son to a private school known for its leniency and indulging his interest in computers. Bill Sr. had once hoped to see his son follow him into law but did not resist too strenuously when he quit Harvard and started Microsoft in 1975 with a friend Paul Allen. The company became an industry powerhouse in the 1980s and made the younger Gates the face of the information technology revolution.For years Mr. Gates’s law firm was one of Microsoft’s preferred legal providers assisting in its defense during the long-running antitrust suit against the company over the bundling of its popular Internet browser with the Windows 95 operating system. (Microsoft and the Justice Department reached a settlement in 2002.)Mary Gates a community volunteer who sat on many corporate boards before her death in 1994 pushed her son early on to start a charitable foundation. The elder Gates said he viewed himself as a caretaker for the foundation until his son gradually stepped back from daily operations at Microsoft.In 1996 Mr. Gates wed Mimi Gardner director of the Seattle Art Museum. In addition to his wife and son survivors include two daughters from his first marriage Kristianne Blake and Elizabeth MacPhee; and eight grandchildren.Beyond the foundation Bill Sr. remained involved in civic life by overseeing a multibillion-dollar fundraising campaign for the University of Washington. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003 and received the American Bar Association’s highest award in 2009.He co-wrote two books one musing on life lessons and the other a defense of the estate tax. As a self-made man whose son had amassed a net worth north of $100 billion he viewed such measures as a moral imperative a means of correcting economic inequities and maintaining a well-functioning democracy.He pointed to research and technology including the Internet that would not have been possible without government investment. Around such technology grows “an innovative robust economy” he told the publication Trusts and Estates in 2003. “And this doesn’t just help the business people who start companies that aggrandize the research. These people buy groceries they rent real estate. The whole economy really moves on the basis of new business new ideas new products new things. That’s how people get rich.“So somebody comes to the end of their life and they’ve got $50 million” he continued. “You couldn’t have had $50 million if you weren’t an American. The estate tax seems more like bill collecting than taxation to me.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/william-gates-sr-a-guiding-hand-of-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-dies-at-94/2020/09/15/4715b8c8-9456-11ea-91d7-cf4423d47683_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
New York City’s shutdown reduced spread of coronavirus by 70 percent, study finds,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/15/virus-nyclockdown/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The city began closing public schools the week of March 15 and imposed stay-at-home orders for everyone except essential workers the following week. Restrictions remained in place until June when the city began gradually reopening while keeping indoor dining and other high-risk activities off-limits.Amesh Adalja an infectious-disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said it is not surprising that shutdowns would curb the spread of the coronavirus.But it is critical to also look at the “whole picture” said Adalja who was not involved in the study. “What are the impacts on other health measures and the overall well-being of a population?”He cited for example the impact that restrictions may have had on the ability for psychiatrically ill patients to go to group therapy or the impact on measles vaccination rates.“The evidence of its ability to decrease covid-19 cases is not evidence for it being a go-to tool” Adalja said adding: “It’s just a blunt tool that can only be used for a very short period of time in dire circumstances. You end up causing a lot of collateral issues that you’ll have to address down the road. The key is to think about public health measures in the long range. What is sustainable?”Masks also played a big role in curbing the spread the researchers found.The forthcoming study found that the widespread use of face coverings was linked to a 7 percent reduction in transmission during the first month the mandate was implemented in public spaces.“But that effectiveness varied very substantially across different age segments of the population” said Wan Yang assistant professor of epidemiology at the Columbia Mailman School.Face coverings helped reduce transmission by about 20 percent among people 65 and older compared with less than 10 percent for most other age groups.Those numbers reflect the reality that people do not always wear their masks consistently or correctly.Yang the study’s lead author said it is not a surprise that older populations had more effective mask behavior compared with younger people who may choose comfort over mask compliance.“The elderly they know they’re at [higher] risk so they’re more willing to wear face masks correctly when they’re outside” she said adding: “Just from personal observation they tend to be more cautious. Sometimes I saw some elderly people wear two masks just to cover all the bases.”If other age groups could model the mask-wearing behavior of older adults universal face-covering could reduce virus transmission by up to 32 percent the researchers wrote. There is “definitely room for improvement” in mask-wearing Yang said.Improving mask-wearing will be key as the city continues to reopen and as more people venture outdoors after months of staying home Yang said especially for “reducing the risk of another resurgence of covid for places that were able to get it under control and are now reopening trying to gain some normalcy after a severe period of the pandemic.”Jeffrey Shaman a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia and a co-author on the study said in a statement “It’s crucial that we find ways to boost consistent and correct mask use in settings where social distancing is not possible.”The researchers used city data on case numbers and deaths as well as mobility data from SafeGraph a company that aggregates cellphone location information to simulate the spread of the coronavirus and estimate transmission. The study was posted on MedRxiv a preprint server for research that has not been peer-reviewed.The findings are especially notable as the state of New York once the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus moves ahead with its reopening stages. All the state’s regions have entered Phase 4 of reopening. For the first time in months New York City diners will be able to eat inside restaurants as of the end of September.The new study on New York’s shutdown measures also comes as a federal judge ruled this week that restrictions ordered by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) to curb the spread of the coronavirus were unconstitutional. President Trump who had repeatedly chided Democratic governors for statewide restrictions applauded the decision and said he hopes it is followed by similar decisions in other states.Adalja said even when they were implemented in New York stay-at-home orders were a “last resort because so many mistakes were made in January and February and March. Hospitals were overrun. We had no ability to know who was infected and who wasn’t.”Yang said research has shown that shutdowns work to limit viral spread even if they are an undesirable strategy.“No one wants a lockdown right? So when it’s implemented it’s really critical” she said. “Our studies show that it is very effective especially for covid. It’s really hard to detect. When you have a substantially high infection rate detected in a population chances are we already have widespread community transmission.”Looking ahead Yang said that in addition to improved mask-wearing public health protocols including contact tracing limiting occupancy in businesses and testing and isolation will all be needed to simultaneously help curb the risk of a resurgence.Public messaging Yang said including about the importance of face coverings is critical.“What can you do to prevent another lockdown? We’re all in the same boat so we should communicate that everyone’s efforts count” she said. “This is not about individuals. In order for it to work we as a society have to act collectively.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/15/virus-nyclockdown/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
What Apple didn’t announce: An iPhone 12,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/15/iphone12-apple-event/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The omission isn’t a surprise but it’s still unusual. For a company that built its brand on innovation Apple has become pretty predictable. Every fall it announces its latest iPhones. The company has announced new iPhones every September since 2012. The year prior in 2011 the iPhone 4s was announced in October.However Apple has delayed the release of its phones before most recently the iPhone X which wasn’t in stores until November.When is the iPhone 12 coming?Analysts expect the new phones to be announced in October at the earliest. Apple confirmed that the iPhone would be late on an earnings call back in July when Luca Maestri the company’s chief financial officer said iPhone supply was going to be available a few weeks later than usual.A month might not seem like a big deal but Apple wants all its new products released and in stock ahead of the holiday rush. That should be especially true if that rush could be dampened by fewer people shopping in stores and families not having holiday gatherings because of the novel coronavirus.A month seems long. What am I even waiting for?Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models ranging in size from 5.4 to 6.7 inches. If they follow Apple’s most recent naming conventions — and the overused trend of slapping “Max” and “Pro” on the end of every product name — we could get an iPhone 12 iPhone 12 Max iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Minor upgrades could include tweaks to the exterior design and better cameras including a depth-sensing back camera. As for design the new iPad Air that Apple announced Tuesday has flat edges which could be a sign of what’s to come on any new iPhones.The main addition will likely be support for 5G the cellular network that promises lightning-fast download and upload speeds ... eventually.Every new iPhone needs one big enticing feature to persuade people to give up the still-functioning iPhone they bought two or so years ago. The iPhone 11 for example added an impressive lowlight mode and tried to make “slofies” happen. IPhone sales have been slowing for years thanks to an end to carrier subsidies and Apple offering inexpensive battery replacements. But with so many people stuck at home and connecting happily over their WiFi its unclear whether 5G will be the jolt to sales Apple wants.Why is it delayed? This is 2020. Up is down the country is simultaneously on fire and fending off hurricanes. Apple CEO Tim Cook is presenting new products to an invisible audience and we’re still in the throes of a pandemic that has hit Apple sales stores and production.Apple warned investors that the virus was disrupting production back in February. In addition to issues with its supply chain much of Apple’s U.S. staff has been working from home and its stores worldwide have had to shut down although many have reopened with new restrictions.Fine no iPhone 12 today. What can I buy soon?Apple announced two new Apple Watches including a lower-cost Apple Watch SE and the Apple Watch Series 6 which can measure blood oxygen levels. Both will be available September 18. A new 8th generation iPad will start at $329 and also be out at the end of week. The $599 and up iPad Air however isn’t coming until some time in October.Additionally sometime before the end of 2020 Apple says you’ll be able to sign up for the new Fitness+ service which will cost $10 a month. Its all-in-one Apple One bundle of various services is coming this fall starting at $15 a month.And the company already released a new phone earlier this year the lower-cost iPhone SE. An update to its last beloved iPhone SE cherished for being small enough to fit into the smallest pocket and sturdy enough to open a beer the new SE is only the same in name and price range.For a quick hit of newness the latest operating systems will be available tomorrow including the new iOS.Do you absolutely have to get something that can connect to 5G right this second? Well Veruca Salt Samsung and OnePlus are here for you and already sell their own 5G phones. The 5G networks however still have some catching up to do.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/15/iphone12-apple-event/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Braden Holtby is expected to hit free agency, Caps GM Brian MacLellan says,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/braden-holtby-capitals-free-agency/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“Yeah I would expect him to go to free agency” MacLellan said. “The goalie market is probably a little unusually deep this year. I talked to his agent last week briefly about where he’s at and the kind of opportunities he’s looking for. I would assume he goes to free agency and we’ll keep in contact with him throughout the free agency period to see if he’s getting what he wants.”The remark from MacLellan is not unexpected given the Capitals’ salary cap situation and previous comments from the club. In late August MacLellan said Holtby’s future was “still to be decided.” When asked about a possible return for the goaltender he said: “I think it’s going to be difficult but sometimes opportunities come up that you don’t expect and I think we’d like to play it out and see what happens.”Holtby who will turn 31 Wednesday is coming off a five-year $30.5 million deal that he signed in 2015. He won the Vezina Trophy in 2016 and helped anchor the Capitals to a Stanley Cup championship in 2018. This season Holtby posted a 25-14-6 record with a .897 save percentage and 3.11 goals against average.The free agency period will open at noon Eastern time on Oct. 9.The free agent goalie market appears deep this offseason — Jacob Markstrom Robin Lehner Anton Khudobin Thomas Greiss Cam Talbot Corey Crawford and Holtby all are expected to be available.The Capitals have Ilya Samsonov waiting in the wings. The 23-year-old netminder suffered an undisclosed injury during the layoff period caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic and did not travel with the team to Toronto for the playoffs instead staying in Washington to undergo treatment. MacLellan said in late August that Samsonov should be ready for the start of training camp whenever that may be.When asked about Washington’s goaltending situation during his introductory news conference Laviolette was highly complimentary of both netminders.“Obviously the goaltending has been a strength for Washington for some time now led by Holtby” Laviolette said. “Where that stands right now I’m not sure with him being a free agent. The opportunity to work with or to have in place a young prospect and a young piece like Samsonov is really I think great for our organization. He’s a big goaltender. He’s proven that he can play. But this is Day 1 without me seeing the players or being on the ice with them but I know that it’s been a strength for the organization for quite some time now and for that we’re pretty fortunate. I’m looking forward to working with both of them if that’s the case.”Read more on the Capitals:,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/braden-holtby-capitals-free-agency/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Ranking the best and worst of the ‘Dancing With the Stars’ premiere, which obviously had a Carole Baskin controversy,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/09/15/dancing-with-stars-premiere-carole-baskin/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Although the Internet ran wild with this allegation creating countless memes and jokes the Lewis family does not find the frenzy amusing. To remind people that they still don’t have answers about Lewis’s disappearance they bought ad time in multiple TV markets during “Dancing With the Stars” on Monday to ask for tips and information. They offered a $100000 reward. “Do you know who did this or if Carole Baskin was involved?” the family’s attorney asks surrounded by Lewis’s daughters and former assistant.Obviously the commercial started making the rounds on social media and Baskin became a worldwide trending topic. Incidentally Baskin (who danced the pasodoble to “Eye of the Tiger”) had the lowest scores of any contestant on opening night.Here’s our ranking of all 15 pairs from the pandemic-era premiere — which featured an audience-free ballroom; new host Tyra Banks; and judges Bruno Tonioli Carrie Ann Inaba and Derek Hough — from best to worst:1) Skai Jackson and Alan Bersten (tango judge scores: 7 7 7 for a total of 21 out of 30 points)Best known as: Actress on Disney Channel shows “Jessie” and “Bunk’d.”Story line: She’s the youngest contestant by far which can be intimidating. Can she overcome her nerves?Performance: Skai already has a shot to become one of the youngest winners ever as she dazzles everyone in her first performance. Bruno admires her mature attitude and Derek declares the sky is the limit. Carrie Ann calls it a “beautiful and exciting” dance and says that if Skai and Alan can work around their height difference they could be serious competitors.2) Kaitlyn Bristowe and Artem Chigvintsev (cha-cha judge scores: 6 7 7 for a total of 20 out of 30 points)Best known as: “Bachelor” contestant who landed her own season of “The Bachelorette” in 2015.Story line: Her longtime dream is to be a dancer. Can she live out her dream and win the show?Performance: The judges are blown away and offer very specific critiques about her form a surefire way to know that they consider her a true contender. Bruno goes with “brilliant” while Carrie Ann and Derek say it’s a terrific start for the first show.3) Justina Machado and Sasha Farber (cha-cha judge scores: 7 7 7 for a total of 21 out of 30 points)Best known as: Actress on Netflix-turned-Pop-TV’s “One Day at a Time” who also starred in “Jane the Virgin” and “Six Feet Under.”Story line: She is determined to not feel too much pressure because she knows she’s not a professional dancer and just wants to have fun. Can she stay stress-free throughout the competition?Performance: Justina may be self-deprecating about her dance skills but she looks like she’s having a blast and Bruno is already out of his seat cheering when she’s done. “The confidence the musicality!” he raves. Carrie Ann adores her. Derek also loves it and says she filled the room with energy and “oozes charisma.”4) Jeannie Mai and Brandon Armstrong (salsa judge scores: 6 6 6 for a total of 18 out of 30 points)Best known as: Stylist TV personality and one of the co-hosts of “The Real.”Story line: She’s out of her comfort zone and wants to prove to herself that she can do anything. Will it work?Performance: Bruno immediately loves it raving that she’s radiant and an all-around “ray of sunshine.” Carrie Ann agrees that she lit up the room and Derek is also impressed but they all critique her balance issues.5) Johnny Weir and Britt Stewart (cha-cha judge scores: 6 6 6 for a total of 18 out of 30 points)Best known as: Olympic figure skater TV commentator (often with Tara Lipinski) and fashion icon.Story line: Figure skating utilizes some of the same skill sets as ballroom dancing but is quite different. Can he succeed?Performance: Derek was a fan but thinks that Johnny gets in his head too much. Bruno compliments his “wonderful lyrical” quality but says he should try to hit his steps more sharply. Carrie Ann declares that Johnny plus DWTS equals heaven but she adds that he needs some improvement to stay in the game.6) Vernon Davis and Peta Murgatroyd (fox trot judge scores: 5 6 6 for a total of 17 out of 30 points)Best known as: NFL star who played for the San Francisco 49ers for almost a decade; won a Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos; and was on the Washington Football Team for three years until he retired in FebruaryStory line: He’s used to dancing in the end zone. Can it translate to the ballroom?Performance: Carrie Ann is impressed with Vernon’s charisma and stage presence but she notes that he needs to work on a few things. Derek is surprised at how skilled Vernon appears to be already while Bruno raves over their “sizzling” chemistry.7) Monica Aldama and Val Chmerkovskiy (fox trot judge scores: 6 7 6 for a total of 19 out of 30 points)Best known as: Head coach of the Navarro College cheerleading team in Texas made famous from Netflix docuseries “Cheer.”Story line: She’s used to coaching other athletes. Will she have trouble being coached?Performance: Derek calls her a breath of fresh air saying it was pleasant and overall lovely to watch. Bruno agrees she nailed the dance although he has some critiques for her arms. Carrie Ann acknowledges the fox trot is a tough dance especially for the first night but says it’s clear that Monica put in a ton of effort.8) Nev Schulman and Jenna Johnson (fox trot judge scores: 7 7 6 for a total of 20 out of 30 points)Best known as: Host of MTV’s “Catfish” which helps people who suspect they are being duped in online relationships.Story line: He’s very much not a dancer. Will that be a problem?Performance: Carrie Ann deems the dance “incredible” and “refined” and she can barely muster up any criticism. Derek proclaims him a “great dancer” although he says he needs to work on his frame while Bruno isn’t quite as enthusiastic but offers a semi-positive critique.9) Jesse Metcalfe and Sharna Burgess (quickstep judge scores: 6 6 6 for a total of 18 out of 30 points)Best known as: The frequently shirtless gardener from ABC’s “Desperate Housewives”; now stars in Hallmark series “Chesapeake Shores.”Story line: He has no dance experience but feels like he has the talent to win the whole show. Is that realistic?Performance: Jesse has definitely been cast in the “hunk” role as the judges gush about the chemistry between the couple and Bruno announces that Jesse “got me into gardening.” Carrie Ann calls it “a little wild” and cautions him to watch his posture but she likes that it had way more passion than you usually see in a quickstep.10) Nelly and Daniella Karagach (salsa judge scores: 5 5 6 for a total of 16 out of 30 points)Best known as: Grammy-winning rapper who blew up the charts in the early 2000s with hits such as “Country Grammar” “Hot in Herre” and “Dilemma” featuring Kelly Rowland.Story line: He’s used to dancing onstage which is extremely different from the ballroom. Can he adjust to this stage?Performance: Producers choose Nelly’s own “Ride Wit Me” and he acknowledges that no he has never performed the salsa to one of his songs before. However he ends with a backflip and the judges are blown away. Bruno is a fan but advises Nelly to keep his shoulders loose while Carrie Ann says Nelly needs to open up more emotionally in his next dance.11) Anne Heche and Keo Motsepe (cha-cha judge scores: 6 6 6 for a total of 18 out of 30 points)Best known as: Emmy-winning actress who dated Ellen DeGeneres in the ’90s; also seen on NBC dramas such as “The Brave” and “Chicago P.D.”Story line: She boasts she’s “half a century” years old. Can she triumph over the younger competitors?Performance: The judges are delighted and seem surprised about that. “You made me smile” Derek exclaims. Bruno thought that it was “very very good” but that Anne could use more hip action; Carrie Ann goes with “incredible” and calls Anne the star of the ballroom.12) AJ McLean and Cheryl Burke (jive judge scores: 6 6 6 for a total of 18 out of 30 points)Best known as: Member of the Backstreet Boys one of the most iconic ’90s boy bands.Story line: The members of ’N Sync were the superior dancers in the boy-band wars. (His partner Cheryl even says so.) Can AJ prove he’s a double threat?Performance: The judges are cautiously optimistic as they like his energy but say he needs to focus on his footwork. Carrie Ann adds that he can’t be afraid to “go big” with his moves even if he’s worried about making mistakes. “You feel comfortable out there. This is going to be great” Derek says.13) Chrishell Stause and Gleb Savchenko (tango judge scores: 4 5 4 for a total of 13 out of 30 points)Best known as: Breakout real estate agent star on Netflix’s reality show “Selling Sunset.”Story line: She has very little (okay zero) dance experience. Can she overcome this issue?Performance: Yikes! Bruno starts out by explaining she got the tango into escrow but they’re far from closing — the real estate metaphor is a kinder way of saying “everything went wrong” which he also bluntly says later on. Carrie Ann adds that Chrishell still has lots of potential despite the fact that she botched the dance.14) Charles Oakley and Emma Slater (salsa judge scores: 4 4 4 for a total of 12 out of 30 points)Best known as: NBA star who played for the Chicago Bulls in the 1980s before going to the New York Knicks for a decade; he retired in 2004. You might have also recently caught him in Michael Jordan’s “The Last Dance” documentary.Story line: He knows little about dance but is excited to learn. Will that be enough to keep him in the competition?Performance: The judges enjoy his enthusiasm but they try to nicely say that he could do much better. He got ahead of the music and Derek notes that he was also flat-footed. Bruno encourages him to turn up the energy.15) Carole Baskin and Pasha Pashkov (pasodoble judge scores: 4 4 3 for a total of 11 out of 30 points)Best known as: Animal activist; Big Cat Rescue owner; and villain of Netflix’s docuseries “Tiger King.”Story line: She has no dance experience. Does that even matter?Performance: It was rough. Carrie Ann appreciates that Carole didn’t hold back but also finds this as surreal as anyone else: “Carole Baskin just danced the pasodoble to ‘Eye of the Tiger’ everyone!” Derek thinks that she “smashed” the dance although Bruno disagrees and thinks the performance was pretty dull. But he knows how this show works: “I’m sure you’ll be back next week.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/09/15/dancing-with-stars-premiere-carole-baskin/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Review | In ‘Here We Are,’ Booker Prize winner Graham Swift casts a spell,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/in-here-we-are-booker-prize-winner-graham-swift-casts-a-spell/2020/09/14/a0d24c2a-f61f-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Graham Swift is no common street performer — he won the Booker Prize in 1996 — but he appreciates the transcendent artistry of small works perfectly performed. His slim new novel “Here We Are” transports us to a seaside theater in Brighton England during the summer of 1959. It’s about young love and the little acts of chance and villainy that realign lives.The theater is nothing special Swift assures us just a variety show sporting jugglers and plate-spinners singers and ventriloquists. But the man who holds the reins is a dashing young emcee named Jack Robinson. The audience has the impression “that it was his show” Swift writes. “They came to be taken under his wing and it wouldn’t have been the same without him. Your pal for the night your host with the most. Off stage he’d say he was just the oil in the wheels — the oilier the better.” That’s not a bad description of this stylish narrator too who keeps the story sliding along so quickly that you’ll barely notice his sleight of hand.It’s Jack’s idea to give his old army buddy Ronnie a break. Ronnie — known professionally as “Pablo” — has an impressive magic act. With his red-lined black cape white gloves and “bold fluid movements” he looks like “Count Dracula’s little brother.” What he needs though is a sexy assistant and as luck would have it Evie is the only one who answers his ad. “They were a natural pair” Swift writes. “The tricks were good but she was the best trick of the lot.” He runs swords through Evie; he makes her levitate; he makes her disappear — and reappear. “The act had become a fluid phenomenon yet full of thrilling tension. You never knew what might happen next. This in itself became part of the attraction.” The audience on the pier goes crazy for the two of them. The local paper says they’ve “taken Brighton by storm.”Although they’re all friends that summer — “a lopsided trio” — Ronnie and Evie’s magic act might even be more popular than Jack himself. Of course as emcee Jack doesn’t mind; the success of the show is all that matters. But poor Evie finds her affections sawed in half.Starting with that ambiguous title “Here We Are” is a novel about the interplay of stage magic and life’s tricks. Like Anne Enright’s “Actress” which was published earlier this year Swift explores the tension between persona and character the strain of maintaining public and private personalities. Actors at least have a professional excuse; the rest of us he suggests perform free donning one costume and role after another. The trouble is we rarely admit it.Five pages into “Here We Are” Swift is already dropping clues about what’s ahead for these summer friends. “Ronnie and Evie” he writes “having had a remarkable debut coming from nowhere to achieve summer fame and having secured for themselves it would seem future booking even a whole career never appeared on stage again. Ronnie never appeared again at all.”If this were a tweedy English mystery the magician’s body would wash up on shore on the last day of summer. But Swift is pursuing subtler crimes and larger mysteries. He has a penchant for long-festering secrets that warp lives. Indeed his 2007 novel “Tomorrow” was a ridiculous fever dream of concealed information. Here fortunately Swift gets the tone just right and the magician’s act provides a wry context for Ronnie’s disappearance.But the real magic may be the way Swift moves through time. Flashbacks unveil young Ronnie’s magical childhood during World War II when London shipped children out into the countryside for safety. And other sections leap ahead half a century to show Evie’s retirement in the early 21th century.Then and now so much depends on the alchemy of luck and desire. With a sigh Swift captures the tragicomedy of human life in a single phrase: “The things that we do.” Before we know it here we are looking back on lives that will never give their secrets away.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/in-here-we-are-booker-prize-winner-graham-swift-casts-a-spell/2020/09/14/a0d24c2a-f61f-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
St. Elizabeths has increased usage of restraints on patients, report says,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/st-elizabeths-hospital/2020/09/15/60ca8882-f673-11ea-a510-f57d8ce76e11_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
From January through April 2019 the last time period the hospital published restraint and seclusion numbers the hospital used restraints 252 times and seclusion 66 times according to city data. In the first three months of 2020 according to the organization’s report the public psychiatric facility restrained patients 149 times and secluded patients 55 times.In addition the report said hospital staffers used drugs to restrain patients more than 600 times between July 2019 and June 2020.“On multiple occasions St. Elizabeths staff disregarded the legal and policy requirements of using restraint and seclusion that were promulgated to prevent widespread use and abuse” the report said.Mark J. Chastang St. Elizabeths chief executive said in a statement that the hospital is committed to the highest standards of patient care.“Our aim is for every patient to get the best and most appropriate treatment to recover and thrive to their fullest potential with family and friends back in the community” he said.A D.C. Department of Behavioral Health official said restraint and seclusion are used in extreme circumstances to prevent aggressive patients from harming themselves staff members or other patients.The amount of time patients spend in restraint or seclusion is below the national average for psychiatric hospitals city officials say.According to D.C. law patients “have the right to be free from seclusion and restraint of any form that is not medically necessary or that is used as a means of coercion discipline convenience or retaliation by staff.” A Department of Behavioral Health report this summer said 3 percent of St. Elizabeths patients were restrained and 3 percent were secluded at some point in June a decrease from July of last year when 10 percent were restrained and 5 percent were secluded.Andrea Procaccino a staff attorney at Disability Rights DC said those numbers do not accurately represent interventions at St. Elizabeths because patients restrained or secluded multiple times are counted only once. In addition she said the number of interventions recently has increased.The Disability Rights DC report also said the organization had viewed surveillance video — not released with the report — that depicted some patients being treated inappropriately.One woman with a history of trauma and sexual abuse was “repeatedly secluded and restrained” in 2019 and 2020 in violation of hospital policy that prohibits those tactics from being used on people with such histories according to the report. The interventions came after the nonprofit reported concerns about the woman’s treatment last year the report said.In February video of one incident showed “a disturbing scene where seven staff five of whom were men converged on her while she was quietly sitting on a mat in the seclusion room” before a male nurse pulled down her pants and injected her in the buttocks according to the report.The report also said the Department of Behavioral Health’s investigation of the incident which has not been publicly released showed that staff members had falsified reports related to the incident and that the nurse who injected the patient had his Maryland nursing license suspended in 2012 for abusing a psychiatric patient there.City officials did not respond to a request for comment about the incident.“Widely used abusive restraints and seclusions are far from respectful or dignified treatment” the report said. “These extreme measures have no therapeutic value cause suffering may trigger severe pain from past trauma and frequently result in emotional and physical harm and even death.”As the use of restraints and seclusion has increased at St. Elizabeths the report said transparency has decreased.Though the hospital still reports when it uses chemical restraints it stopped publicly reporting instances of physical restraints and seclusion in May of last year.Procaccino compared the treatment of some St. Elizabeths patients to the scenes of George Floyd being restrained by Minneapolis police leading to his death.When staffers respond to patient behavior with a show of force she said patients react forcefully themselves trapping the facility in an escalating “cycle of violence.”Lewis Bossing senior staff attorney at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law a D.C.-based advocacy group called restraint and seclusion traumatizing and harmful. He said people of color are disproportionately subjected to the treatments.“The practice — in my view as in the view of many stakeholders in this system — is just as harmful as whatever is the threat” he said.Founded in 1855 St. Elizabeths was the nation’s first federally funded mental hospital. Some patients are criminal defendants including those awaiting competence hearings and found not guilty by reason of insanity.St. Elizabeths was struggling even before the coronavirus pandemic.In October of last year the hospital’s water system was beset by an outbreak of legionella bacteria which can cause the potentially fatal Legionnaires’ disease. Although no one fell ill psychiatric patients had to drink bottled water and bathe in mobile outdoor showers for nearly a month.Hospital officials also struggled to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the first weeks of the pandemic.Before this summer 14 patients and one staff member died as a result of the virus according to city numbers. No subsequent virus-related deaths have occurred.Procaccino said that her organization for years has documented problems at St. Elizabeths including issues with restraints and seclusion highlighted in previous reports.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/st-elizabeths-hospital/2020/09/15/60ca8882-f673-11ea-a510-f57d8ce76e11_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Israel signs deal establishing formal ties with two Arab states at the White House,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-israel-middle-east/2020/09/15/e4c2630a-f75c-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The agreements mark the third and fourth Arab nations to normalize relations with Israel — and the first since Jordan took the step in 1994 following Egypt in 1979. Trump took full credit for setting the path and encouraging them to take it. A White House statement attributed the success to his “foreign policy vision and his acumen as a dealmaker.”But the countries involved Trump said Tuesday “had to make that choice themselves.”In formal remarks each leader delivered in turn from a podium set on the White House balcony looking down on the audience both Trump and Netanyahu said that other Arab countries were prepared to take the same step.At various points during the day Trump said that five six and “seven or eight or nine” Arab countries were queuing up to join. “Including the big ones” he told reporters as he returned to the South Lawn later in the day to depart for an evening trip to Philadelphia. Asked about Saudi Arabia he said that he had been in frequent contact with King Salman and that “at the right time I think they will come in.”The last-minute addition of Bahrain whose announcement that it would normalize ties with Israel followed that of the UAE with far less fanfare was seen as a sign of Saudi approval. The small island monarchy in the Persian Gulf is highly dependent on economic and security ties with the Saudis and closely coordinates its foreign policy with Riyadh.After finishing their speeches on the balcony — from which opera singers serenaded the Trump family when he accepted the Republican nomination for reelection less than three weeks ago — the four men walked down the sweeping outdoor staircase to sit at a long table facing the seated crowd said by the White House to number about 800.The United States Israel the UAE and Bahrain all signed the Abraham Accords — named for the three Abrahamic religions rooted in what is now Israel and surrounding lands — that lays the ground for diplomatic economic and other ties between Israel and the Persian Gulf neighbors. The two Arab states then signed bilateral agreements with Israel.In addition to their historic nature the agreements are also significant for relegating the Palestinians to the sidelines. Palestinian leaders have rejected the Trump peace efforts for three years charging that they benefited Israel and have called the two Arab nations traitors to their cause.Addressing reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Netanyahu Trump predicted that the Palestinians would eventually come on board. “Obviously we speak to them” he said even as he recalled that his administration had cut off $750 million in funding to the Palestinians because “they treat the United States so badly.”Neither the UAE nor Bahrain is or ever has been at war with Israel so the documents are not peace treaties in the formal sense. But until now both Persian Gulf states had officially considered Israel to be illegitimate.Arab states in the Persian Gulf have edged closer to Israel over the past decade some with extensive but largely unpublicized ties in response to a shared desire to blunt Iranian influence in the region.Trump greeted all three leaders in the Oval Office separately before the signing ceremony. As he sat there with Netanyahu he once again expressed a desire to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear program after earlier in his administration ripping up an accord reached by Tehran with the Obama administration to curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions.He said he had been in communications with Iranian representatives and told them “you should wait to see the [U.S.] election first.” Trump also said “there is nothing . . . Iran would like to see better than Sleepy Joe Biden elected.”But “I’m going to make a much better deal” he said predicting his own victory. “Iran will be very rich and very quickly.”The ceremony received wide and favorable attention in largely government-influenced news coverage throughout most of the Persian Gulf. One partial exception was in Qatar whose Al Jazeera online quoted a Palestinian Authority official calling the signing a “sad day.”“The only path for peace for the Palestinians is ending this brutal Israeli occupation and granting the Palestinians their inalienable rights for self-determination. Without that there is no path to peace in the region” Al Jazeera quoted Ammar Hijazi assistant minister of multilateral affairs for the Palestinian Authority as saying.Hijazi called the White House ceremony a “photo op” that “only crowns Israel as the policeman of the region” and paves the way for more U.S. weapons sales to the Arab countries.Qatar has ruled out normalization of ties with Israel until the Palestinians are granted their own state within borders from before Israel conquered significant territory in a 1967 war and with East Jerusalem as its capital. Those conditions are part of the Arab Peace Initiative written by Saudi Arabia and unanimously adopted by the Arab League in 2002 and which remains at least symbolically the group’s joint position.Of the four leaders at the White House only Abdullah bin Zayed the UAE foreign minister mentioned either of the two outstanding concerns that have been raised about the new accords. In exchange for normalization with the UAE Netanyahu agreed to suspend plans to annex Israeli-occupied parts of the West Bank but it remains unclear how long that suspension will last.“Thank you for choosing peace and for halting the annexation of Palestinian territories a position that reinforces our shared will to achieve a better future for generations to come” Zayed said in remarks directed at Netanyahu during his balcony speech.The other issue is what the White House has said is the potential sale of F-35s the sophisticated U.S. stealth fighter jet to the UAE. Only Israel has the planes in the Middle East and many Israelis as well as members of Congress have raised concerns that selling them to the Emiratis would violate U.S. law requiring a “qualitative military edge” for Israel in its neighborhood.The agreements have garnered widespread bipartisan support but lawmakers have expressed some concerns. In a statement House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) cited questions “regarding the commitment that the UAE has received from the Trump administration to purchase American-made F-35 aircraft.”“It is also critically important that we fully understand the agreements’ details regarding the announced freeze of efforts by Israel to annex portions of the West Bank” she said.Israelis watched the White House ceremony closely Tuesday evening with all TV channels halting regular broadcasts to bring live images from Washington.The broadcasts were interrupted only to report on a sudden round of rockets fired by Palestinian militants in Gaza as the leaders gave empowering speeches about forging peace.Air raid sirens sounded in the coastal cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon with Israeli police saying that a rocket had left two people injured. The rocket fire was seen by Israelis as a message of disapproval from the militant Islamic group Hamas which governs the Gaza Strip.In Israeli reports on the Washington ceremony close attention was paid to whether Netanyahu and members of his entourage were wearing masks and social distancing. As the novel coronavirus soars in Israel and the country heads into a second nationwide lockdown Friday the start of the Jewish High Holy Days Netanyahu’s decision to leave the country was closely scrutinized.Few masks were in evidence at the ceremony and no social distancing was enforced. In apparent deference to coronavirus protocols however there were no embraces or shaken hands among the leaders. Instead they saluted each other Middle Eastern-style with hands on their hearts.Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem and Felicia Sonmez in Washington contributed to this story.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-israel-middle-east/2020/09/15/e4c2630a-f75c-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Gochugaru transforms this one-pan chicken dish into something truly exciting,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/09/10/gochugaru-transforms-this-one-pan-chicken-stir-fry-into-something-truly-exciting/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Overview Ingredients Steps Overview Like everyone else I know I’ve been cooking at home much more than usual these past several months. I have enjoyed it and have been eating well but after awhile I found myself getting bored with my own culinary repertoire. To get out of my rut I turned to a new cookbook for inspiration “My Korea: Traditional Flavors Modern Recipes” by Hooni Kim (W.W. Norton & Company 2020). I have made several wonderful recipes from it and each though not difficult involved techniques and flavors quite different from those I typically lean on at home. It was just what I needed to get my mojo back. Part of the thrill came from the discovery of a new-to-me spice gochugaru coarsely ground Korean red chile flakes which is used in kimchi as well as many other Korean dishes. The chile has a moderate heat with a deep savory flavor and a hint of sweet smokiness. It captivated me so much I started sprinkling it on everything: eggs avocado toast turkey burgers fish for my fish tacos potatoes pizza — you name it. Here gochugaru puts an exciting spin on one of my go-to summer skillet suppers. Mixed with granulated garlic salt and cayenne pepper it makes a deeply flavorful rub for boneless chicken breast. Cooked in a skillet the chicken takes on a brick-red hue and has a moderately spicy kick (add or eliminate the cayenne to adjust the heat to your liking). Building on the meaty flavor and dissolving the flavor-packed brown bits in the pan I added mushrooms to the skillet to yield their liquid then garlic and ginger before stirring in fresh late-summer sweet corn and zucchini. The end result is a boldly flavorful healthful one-pan meal with just the spark I needed. You can find gochugaru in Asian markets online and in well-stocked supermarkets but you can also substitute ancho chile powder or regular chili powder for it in this dish for a still delicious but different taste profile. Where to buy: Gochugaru can be found at Asian markets well-stocked supermarkets or online. Ingredients 1 1/2 teaspoons gochugaru (Korean chile flakes; may substitute ancho chile powder or regular chili powder) 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt divided 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper or to taste 1 1/4 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast pounded to 1/2-inch thick 2 tablespoons canola oil or another neutral oil divided 8 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms or a mix of mushrooms such as shiitake oyster and/or cremini sliced 2 to 3 tablespoons water plus more as needed 1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions white and light green parts plus more for serving 1 tablespoon minced or finely grated fresh ginger 1 medium zucchini (8 ounces) trimmed quartered lengthwise and sliced 1/2-inch thick 1 1/2 cups (8 ounces) corn kernels (from 3 ears of corn or if frozen thawed) Steps Step 1 In a small bowl combine the gochugaru 1/4 teaspoon salt the granulated garlic and cayenne pepper. Sprinkle the spice mixture onto both sides of the chicken rubbing it in a little with your fingers. Step 2 In a large skillet over medium-high heat heat 1 tablespoon oil until shimmering.

Sean Doolittle is done for the season. But he wants a different ending in Washington.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/sean-doolittle-nationals-future/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Sean Doolittle’s season ended with an injury and his future in Washington is up in the air. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) Sean Doolittle couldn’t see past the immediate damage. When he looked into the empty stands last Thursday night the vacant blue seats were just vacant blue seats not yet a reminder of the fans who loved him and may never watch him pitch for their team again. He was focused on limping down the dugout steps. His mind was glued to the sharp pain in his right side an oblique strain that minutes earlier had felt like his hip bone collided with his ribs. He’d been going so well springing off the injured list for six sharp appearances remaking himself into the pitcher he once was. Now he disappeared down the tunnel. The reality was that that moment — 9:29 p.m. on Sept. 10 2020 — could have been his last in a Washington Nationals uniform. The weight of it crept up in the coming days after an MRI confirmed he was out for the season. He could hardly move around his D.C. home leaving him to binge-read a mystery novel and think. A four-season run started with a trade Doolittle didn’t want. He’d been a member of the Oakland Athletics organization for a decade. He felt they were on the cusp of contending. Then he took to Washington in ways he didn’t expect. He and his wife Eireann Dolan were married here in 2017. They’ve connected to the community through a number of charity efforts. On the field Doolittle was an all-star in 2018 and a World Series champion in 2019. He also battled injuries and some of the worst innings of his career. Through all of it he grew. And now at the end of a season played through the novel coronavirus pandemic there are two paths for his future: He could leave the Nationals without a proper send-off. Or Doolittle could re-sign with Washington in free agency and continue his rebound next spring. He’s really hoping for the latter. “That would be the best-case scenario” Doolittle told The Post on Monday. “It’s a little bit nerve-racking for sure. Just going through this process I don’t want to like get my hopes up or have favorites or spots like oh man ‘I really hope this works out with this team’ or whatever … what what?” A voice was chiming in from the background. “Eireann is sitting across the table from me and says ‘I want to stay here’ ” Doolittle added with a laugh. “She says: ‘Print it.’ ” Dolan says something else the words a bit muffled and Doolittle again played middle man in his own interview. “On the record. Print it” he repeated. “She’s serious.” [Svrluga: Baseball has never been so lonely and players are feeling the strain] Doolittle turns 34 this month. He has never been a free agent or gone through arbitration. He signed a five-year $10.5 million extension with the Athletics in 2014 designed for stability and a steady income. It included two club options — for $6 million in 2019 $6.5 million for 2020 — and the Nationals exercised both. The second made him an integral part of last October’s championship run. Sean Doolittle and the Nationals celebrated Washington’s World Series victory last year. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) But then came the pandemic and Doolittle struggled. He couldn’t throw off a mound during the sport’s four-month shutdown. When it restarted in July his body was fatigued and he developed bad habits in his delivery. He wasn’t pushing off the mound the right way. His fastball velocity sagged before settling into the high 80s and the early results were troubling. The lefty yielded seven hits and five earned runs in the first two weeks of the season. Three of the 18 hitters he faced took him deep. It was “really scary” he says now to feel fine physically and be all but serving batting practice to opponents. So the Nationals put him on the injured list citing right knee fatigue and gave him 13 days in Fredericksburg Va. to reset. “There were weeks there where I thought it was just gone forever” Doolittle recalled. “I was like ‘Uh well I just throw 88 with no life now. I’m going to have to figure out how to get guys out again.’ I thought about learning how to throw a sinker like could I just dive bomb sinkers maybe and be a sinker-curveball guy? If these are my mechanics now for some reason can I use them to create a new version of myself?” [From July: Sean Doolittle sees sports as a reward America hasn’t earned yet] It wouldn’t come to that. Doolittle found a fix a tweak to his lower-half mechanics that restored his fastball velocity and movement. The hour-long drives to Fredericksburg straight south down Interstate 95 became something to anticipate. He had long phone conversations with Manager Dave Martinez. He tore through video. He was energized by catches with top pitching prospects whose fastballs stung inside his mitt. In the spring while the pandemic raged when the country erupted with protests after the death of George Floyd who was killed while in police custody Doolittle had wondered how long he would play. He has many interests beyond baseball. He was initially unsure about participating in 2020. He could have finished out his contract and hung it up on his terms. But this season — however frustrating however exacting on his mental health at times — reconnected him with baseball. He says that returning in August pitching four scoreless innings being in the bullpen and clubhouse is some of the most fun he has had. He makes that clear when he explains why he wants to stay in Washington. He first mentions Martinez then the strength and conditioning staff then his teammates then wanting to reward everyone who helped him through the summer. [Sean Doolittle on declining White House invite: ‘I don’t want to hang out with somebody who talks like that’] “This just reminded me how much I love it and how I want to continue with baseball as long as it will let me” Doolittle said. “With the quarantine and the negotiations and covid we weren’t sure if we were going to play at all and then I land on the IL and I’m so ineffective that it’s scary. It scared me. Some doubt starts to creep in and then to be able to get it right and come back and have the support of everybody behind you … “I don’t know it was absolutely a roller coaster of emotions. But I’m very grateful for it.” Sean Doolittle limped off the field earlier this month. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press) Now comes the hard part — being judged on an uneven performance. Doolittle plans to live wherever he can best rehab his oblique this winter. He wants to send tape and velocity numbers to teams as soon as possible. In a recent news conference Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo wouldn’t discuss Doolittle’s pending free agency. But he did note the reliever’s stark improvements adding that he believes there’s even more in Doolittle’s tank. The first step for Doolittle was believing that himself. The next in a perfect world would be proving it in Washington. “This has been our home for four years” Doolittle said. “This city means so much to us.” Read more on baseball: Trea Turner’s stock is skyrocketing.

Opinion | Protests and Trump rallies both carry covid-19 risks. But there’s a reason Trump’s rallies are worse.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/protests-and-trump-rallies-both-carry-covid-19-risks-but-theres-a-reason-trumps-rallies-are-worse/2020/09/15/a677ddde-f791-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
But there is one key difference between social justice protests and Trump rallies: Those attending BLM protests by and large grasp the danger and are motivated to reduce their risk while a large share of those attending Trump rallies deny that there is a danger at all.I had a patient a woman in her 60s with chronic medical conditions who told me she followed covid-19 precautions to the point that she only left her house once a day to take a walk. She had all of her groceries delivered and she didn’t even see her grandchildren because they attended day care. Yet she felt strongly that she needed take part in an anti-racism protest. She’d lost family members to police brutality and she was willing to risk her life to show her commitment to the movement.As her doctor I couldn’t recommend that she participate in an activity that could compromise her health. But since she was going no matter what it was my job to help her stay as safe as possible.This is the public health concept of harm reduction. Protesting involves risk but she could still substantially reduce that risk by being outdoors wearing a mask avoiding dense crowds limiting her time there and not using public transportation. My patient chose a protest within walking distance of her house. She made sure to stay at the outer edge of the crowd where she was able to maintain a six-foot distance from others most of the time.These harm-reduction opportunities continue after an event ends and participants return to their homes. My patient lived alone but at her protest those who live with others were instructed to self-quarantine for at least five days and then get tested. During the protests organizers followed public health guidance to educate participants about how to protect themselves and others. Many cities have helped by offering free testing for protesters.Not everyone follows every guideline of course but overall such harm-reduction practices appear to have worked. A research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research examined patterns of spread in more than 300 major cities and found “no evidence that net covid-19 case growth differentially rose following the onset of Black Lives Matter protests.”Where are the harm-reduction practices at Trump’s rallies? The most recent events in Nevada and Arizona have been held indoors. Compared with those outdoors indoor gatherings could increase the risk of transmission by 18 to 19 times. Many attendees appeared to not wear masks. Some rallygoers in Michigan called covid-19 a “fake pandemic” and spoke about mask-wearing as an infringement on their rights. Trump himself was not wearing a mask at the rallies. He used his platform to mock public health practices.It seems reasonable then to worry that many attendees engage in other risky behaviors such as hugging and shaking hands. Do they participate in higher-transmission activities before and after rallies such as going to tightly packed bars and indoor restaurants? When they return to home do they ignore guidance to self-quarantine and get tested?And that’s the key difference between social justice protests and Trump’s political rallies. This is what public health experts should counter with when we come under fire for appearing to support one cause over the other. It’s not our job to judge why people are at an event but it is our duty to explain — based on science — what makes one event higher-risk than another.To be clear from an epidemiological perspective there shouldn’t be any mass gatherings during a pandemic. But let’s not engage in false equivalencies. The reason Trump’s rallies are more dangerous than social justice protests has nothing to do with the purpose of the gatherings and everything to do with the behavior of organizers and participants.The distinction is this: Are attendees going in spite of the risk or in defiance of it?,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/protests-and-trump-rallies-both-carry-covid-19-risks-but-theres-a-reason-trumps-rallies-are-worse/2020/09/15/a677ddde-f791-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Opinion | I directed ‘Cuties.’ This is what you need to know about modern girlhood.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cuties-director-maimouna-doucoure-why-i-made-the-film/2020/09/15/7e0ee406-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The result was my movie "Mignonnes" or "Cuties" in English. I wanted to make a film in the hope of starting a conversation about the sexualization of children. The movie has certainly started a debate though not the one that I intended.Puberty is such a confusing time. You are still a child with all that wonderful naivete and innocence but your body is changing and you're self-conscious and curious about its impact on others all at the same time.The stories that the girls I spoke to shared with me were remarkably similar. They saw that the sexier a woman is on Instagram or TikTok the more likes she gets. They tried to imitate that sexuality in the belief that it would make them more popular. Spend an hour on social media and you'll see preteens — often in makeup — pouting their lips and strutting their stuff as if they were grown women. The problem of course is that they are not women and they don't realize what they are doing. They construct their self-esteem based on social media likes and the number of followers they have.To see these youngsters put so much pressure on themselves so early was heartbreaking. Their insights and experiences with social media informed "Cuties."The main character in the film is an 11-year-old girl called Amy whose family like mine came from Senegal and lives in Paris. Frustrated by her mother's failure to take control of her own life Amy decides to seek freedom by joining a clique of girls at school who are preparing to enter a local dance contest and design increasingly risque routines copying what they've seen on their phones. The girls don't have the maturity however to realize what their gestures and dance moves look like to the audience. It is only in seeing the shock on parents' faces in the audience and at the same time thinking of what her mother is going through that Amy realizes that these dance routines bring no freedom at all. She chooses her own path balancing her family's traditional roots and the more liberal city in which she lives.Some people have found certain scenes in my film uncomfortable to watch. But if one really listens to 11-year-old girls their lives are uncomfortable.We as adults have not given children the tools to grow up healthy in our society. I wanted to open people's eyes to what's truly happening in schools and on social media forcing them to confront images of young girls made up dressed up and dancing suggestively to imitate their favorite pop icon. I wanted adults to spend 96 minutes seeing the world through the eyes of an 11-year-old girl as she lives 24 hours a day. These scenes can be hard to watch but are no less true as a result. Like most 11- and 12-year-olds our actors in the film had already seen these types of dances and more. Despite this during filming we were extremely mindful of their age. A trained counselor was present on set. There was no nudity except for a one-second shot in which the main characters see the exposed breast of an actress over 18 while watching a video of a dance routine on a grainy mobile screen. The project was even approved by the French government's child protection authorities.This film is my own story. All my life I have juggled two cultures: Senegalese and French. As a result people often ask me about the oppression of women in more traditional societies. And I always ask: But isn't the objectification of women's bodies in Western Europe and the United States another kind of oppression? When girls feel so judged at such a young age how much freedom will they ever truly have in life?And that's why I made "Cuties": to start a debate about the sexualization of children in society today so that maybe — just maybe — politicians artists parents and educators could work together to make a change that will benefit children for generations to come. It's my sincerest hope that this conversation doesn't become so difficult that it too gets caught up in today's "cancel culture.",body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cuties-director-maimouna-doucoure-why-i-made-the-film/2020/09/15/7e0ee406-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Opinion | The Supreme Court must step in to stop Florida Republicans from disenfranchising voters,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-supreme-court-must-step-in-to-stop-florida-republicans-from-disenfranchising-voters/2020/09/15/60b8dbe0-f6d3-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Shortly after Floridians voted via a state constitutional amendment to enfranchise felons who had finished their prison sentences the GOP legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) moved to require that to register ex-convicts not only finish serving their prison terms but also pay any fines or fees owed. This subversion of the ballot measure voters had just approved is a modern-day poll tax: Wealthy felons can easily afford to pay any court fees while poorer felons might struggle paying off their debts.Moreover some 85000 released-felon Floridians already had registered to vote. Reversing course after the fact would require election officials to try to go name by name striking those who still owed court fees without an accessible centralized database from which to pull the needed information. The system is so opaque many felons themselves do not know whether they owe anything.In other words injustice and chaos are what the 11th Circuit endorsed Friday when it sided with Mr. DeSantis. The voter-approved amendment commands the state “to automatically restore the right to vote for people with prior felony convictions except those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense upon completion of their sentences including prison parole and probation.” Republicans and the 11th Circuit argue that paying off fines and fees falls under the amendment’s definition of completing one’s sentence even if state bureaucracy or poverty make doing so impossible. Three of the six judges joining in the 11th Circuit’s dubious ruling are on President Trump’s list of possible Supreme Court picks should he win a second term.Understandably the Supreme Court often resists meddling in election procedure disputes as Election Day approaches. But the argument to make an exception in this case is compelling. The partisan intent behind the Republican effort is clear. The campaign to ignore the will of the voters is egregious. The practical consequences of a chaotic last-minute disenfranchisement of possibly tens of thousands in a swing state just weeks before a presidential election in the middle of a pandemic that already makes running an election extremely difficult could be severe. The Supreme Court must step in.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-supreme-court-must-step-in-to-stop-florida-republicans-from-disenfranchising-voters/2020/09/15/60b8dbe0-f6d3-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Hurricane Sally sits in the Gulf, but along the coast deadly flood waters are rising.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/09/15/hurricane-sally-biloxi-mobile-floods/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
But it meant as much as 30 inches of rain could fall along the coasts of those states and up to five feet of storm surge could inundate coastal communities. Forecasters said there could be record flooding along rivers in Northwest Florida parts of Alabama and perhaps Georgia.“The slow forward speed is likely to result in a historical rainfall event for the north-central Gulf Coast” the National Hurricane Center posted in an online discussion about the storm Tuesday.Sally’s wobbly movement also makes it hard to predict where it will strike land. On Monday meteorologists predicted it would hit Biloxi Miss. but that changed Tuesday and Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich was relieved.“We’re real thankful that we were spared the storm surge” Gilich said. “Four to six feet they’re predicting. That’s a lot better than seven or 11.”But in Mobile Ala. County Commissioner Merceria Ludgood watched with dread as predictions pointed their way.“We’re telling people that there’s going to be a lot of water” Ludgood said from an emergency management facility where she and other officials planned to ride out the storm. “The ground can only hold so much of it. Don’t wait to leave.”Mobile is a city with thousands of oak trees that could tumble when their root systems are soaked. It is also adorned with rivers canals and the enormous Big Creek Lake that is prone to flooding said Mike Evans deputy director of the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency.Evans said the county has been divided into evacuation zones. Residents south of Interstate 10 as well as those east of Interstate 65 in Mobile Bay and the network of rivers that feed it should get out he said.The county sheriff commissioned a 15-ton military grade vehicle to respond if residents who decide to hunker down are trapped. But Evans hopes it doesn’t come to that. When the hurricane hits public officials emergency personnel included planned to shelter in place.Emergency officials gently asked Mobile County residents to impose on friends and family inland to put them up for a while. Theodore High School where the county established a shelter can usually hold up to a thousand evacuees. But social distancing as a result of the coronavirus pandemic has limited occupation to only 300.Downtown Mobile was mostly empty Tuesday with businesses in the flood-prone area closed in advance of Hurricane Sally. Signs of a hurricane’s approach were a common sight: boarded windows sandbagged doors and streets barricaded in places where water was expected to surge.Hayley’s Bar was one of a few exceptions. Doors were open and three customers enjoyed afternoon drinks. None seemed concerned about the coming storm.“The city floods on like a normal rainy day” said Grace Foster 23. “Here we have rain tropical storms hurricanes. We’re kind of due for a good hurricane.”Foster and the other patrons live within walking distance of Hayley’s. They said they were ready for whatever Sally might bring.“We are all stocked up for covid already so we had a lot of the stuff we need” said Tres Wiggins 28.“I just moved all my plants inside” Foster said “and we stocked up on alcohol.”Heading south toward Dauphin Island Ala. Sally’s effects were more visible Tuesday as floodwaters from Mobile Bay began spilling across roads.Sonya Gunderson 60 was having a ball at a retreat on the island where she traveled from Iowa to meet seven friends who fished the ocean and frolicked on the beach.But Sally chased them off the vulnerable strip of land into a condo in Mobile.On Tuesday she walked in a steady downpour downtown wearing a blue raincoat and carrying a pan a lighter and some candles — supplies borrowed from the property manager in advance of the storm’s impact.“All of our events are canceled” Gunderson said. “We had deep sea fishing dinner on the ocean. Now we’re just playing games.”At a popular fishing spot near Buccaneer Yacht Club Robert Boykin 62 sat with his wife in one of a dozen parked cars looking out over the bay’s unusually choppy waters.“I just hope it doesn’t get too bad because I only stay a mile or two from here” Boykin said.For Boykin and others Sally’s snail-paced approach made it hard to know just when to hunker down.“We’re here looking now” he said. “But as soon as we get home we’re going to be there.”In Biloxi the city’s eight casinos were still temporarily shut after the storm turned east. One casino flashed a sign saying “Sorry.”Since 2005 residents have compared major storms to Hurricane Katrina which pummeled the city with 28 feet of storm surges that are still marked in blue paint on telephone poles.“We got wiped off the face of the Earth” said Karen Parrott 63 as she took an afternoon stroll to the shore with her husband Bill also 63.The couple said they were not worried about Hurricane Sally.“Not after Katrina” she said.Across the Route 110 bridge that links Biloxi to the city of D’Iberville Miss. a pair of friends chatted as the high tide covered picnic tables and seeped into the road. They said they were not expecting much from Sally.“It’s doubtful this late in the season” said Joshua Jackson 27 a construction worker from the community of Vancleave Miss. who stopped to hang out under the bridge on his way home from work in Gulfport Miss.But the Biloxi mayor — a lifelong resident — said he was not prepared to declare storm season over.“Who knows?” Gilich said about it noting that in his State of the City address in January he had predicted a great year ahead. “Don’t you just feel really good about 2020?” he recalled saying in his speech.“Boy was I wrong” he said with an eye roll. “I’m not going to say that again."In Northwest Florida Escambia and Santa Rosa county officials imposed voluntary evacuation orders for coastal and low-lying areas urging vulnerable residents to seek higher ground.“Flooding is one of the most serious concerns we have with this storm” Escambia County Emergency Manager Eric Gilmore said during a Tuesday afternoon news conference. “The amount of rain and storm surge will make this a historic event."The brand-new Pensacola Bay Bridge one of only two evacuation routes off Santa Rosa Island and Pensacola Beach was shut down Tuesday when a barge operated by a state contractor collided with the structure.Local officials suspended tolls for the nearby Garcon Point Bridge to make it easier for residents to evacuate.On the other side of Escambia Bay in downtown Pensacola about 100 residents had hunkered down at a local civic center turned storm shelter by midafternoon.Michael Kimberl director of the Alfred Washburn Center which serves the homeless spent much of the last 24 hours ferrying the homeless to the civic center.“I’ve been driving shuttle most of the afternoon and last night trying to get people to shelters” said Kimberl who dropped off about 30 people there by 3 p.m. Tuesday.Kimberl worried he wouldn’t be able to reach all of the area’s homeless before the storm made landfall and felt local authorities were partially to blame for waiting too long to announce local shelter openings.“We had about 100 people at the center yesterday afternoon” he said. “Had I known about the shelter before we closed I could have sent them there.”Cusick reported from Mobile Sacchetti reported from Biloxi Strickland reported from Pensacola and Fears reported from D.C.

Who needs another Zoom call? Why sending letters might help your loved ones.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/letters-pandemic-depression-anxiety-help/2020/09/14/47b3bb3a-f3b1-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
But we can take another approach: sending handwritten letters. The old-fashioned gesture could be particularly beneficial now: The pandemic is adversely affecting Americans’ mental health and research suggests that being contacted by letter can lower the risk of suicide. Besides after months of remote work and virtual communication many people might welcome a tangible alternative to yet another Zoom call. Feel awkward writing a nondigital missive? No worries we have you covered.If you know someone who is troubled that person is not alone. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there has been a stark increase in emotional distress among Americans since the pandemic began. In June nearly 31 percent of U.S. adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression while almost 11 percent said that they had seriously considered suicide. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms alone was about triple that of the same time period in 2019.One contributing factor to the national mental health struggle during the pandemic has been the ongoing social isolation plaguing millions of Americans. It’s the greatest concern of Amanda Spray clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. “Social isolation is a symptom of depression” she says “and it leads to worsening of depression.”“[Letters] help provide social support even if you can’t be there with your friend or family member holding their hand and being by their side” says Spray who is also the director of the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Center at NYU Langone Health.Research indicates that such support can have a significant impact on recipients’ mental health. One study conducted at Stanford University in the early 1970s followed more than 800 people after they had been discharged from the hospital for depression or suicidal tendencies. One group of patients received handwritten letters from a health-care provider they knew in the five years following discharge while the other group received no letters. Patients in the letter-receiving group had lower rates of suicide over the five-year period.A more recent study looked at a new treatment for those who recently attempted suicide. The treatment involved three therapy sessions followed by two years of receiving personalized letters. There was an approximately 80 percent reduced risk of a repeat suicide attempt in the group who received letters.Psychiatrist Jena Lee medical director of pediatric emergency psychiatry at UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital says that when patients are at a crisis point — meaning they’ve attempted suicide or are seriously considering it — they often can’t name one person they trust or who they know cares about them. Letters can counter that feeling.“If I had a superpower and could change one thing for everyone that would make the biggest impact for all mental illness it would be that everyone had one person who cares for them” Lee says.The medium is as important as the message. People consider letters meaningful because so much effort goes into sending them. It takes time to find the right stationery think about what to write buy postage stamps look up the person’s address and find a postbox. “It requires a kind of deliberation that is so lacking in our time of fast-paced messaging and media” Lee says. “When you receive a handwritten letter you reflexively start imagining the author sitting down and reflecting thinking about you. . . . That’s why it’s so very effective at showing someone does care about you.”Early in the pandemic Good Juju Ink a stationery brand headquartered in San Francisco launched 18 Million Thanks an initiative designed to support front-line workers through handwritten cards. Ryan Kissick head of operations for Good Juju Ink says one registered nurse in Alaska got in touch with them after receiving a letter.“She said ‘This is not a fun time to be a nurse. I got a thank-you note from a patient’s spouse and I sobbed. It does matter. We are making a difference. We are all in this together’ ” Kissick says.To support a lonely or isolated friend with a handwritten letter keep these tips in mind: Don’t worry about finding the perfect thing to say. Emily McDowell is the writer and illustrator behind Emily McDowell & Friends a stationery brand known for its clever colorfully designed empathy cards. The cards were born of her experience having cancer at 24.“The hardest thing about having cancer was not losing my hair or those other things you hear about” she says. “It was the loneliness I felt when friends and family didn’t know what to say and ended up disappearing as a result.”Lee emphasizes the importance of being as sincere and personal as possible instead of focusing on writing the perfect message. “Sometimes we get so distracted trying to find the right things to say we don’t even realize that we sacrifice being absolutely genuine” she says.Picture the recipient before you begin writing. Instead of thinking about yourself and what to say envision the other person. What do you like about them? Why are you grateful to have them in your life? Have you ever learned anything meaningful from them?“If there’s anything you can think of that you learned from that person either directly or indirectly that’s very helpful” Lee says. “When we feel someone has benefited from us I think that boosts our self-esteem even if we don’t realize it.”Select a memorable piece of stationery. We all love the feeling of knowing that someone picked out a notecard just for us. Select a relevant pandemic-specific card (such as this one or this one) that your recipient will always remember. “When you’re in a tender moment you’re not going to be sitting on the floor sifting through 10000 text messages on the cloud to find the one that was meaningful” says Ali O’Grady founder and chief executive of Thoughtful Human one of the stationery brands participating in 18 Million Thanks. “You’re sitting on the floor going through your box of treasures.”Focus on the future. If possible share your hopes for something you wish to do or experience with the other person once the pandemic has ended. “That lens in the letter helps that person — and yourself — be a little bit more future-oriented” Lee says. “It exudes some hope.”Remember the elderly. Not only are older family members less likely to be tech-savvy enough for a video chat but they’re also more prone to loneliness Lee says.“I think they’re especially vulnerable throughout this pandemic for so many reasons” Lee says. “Letters could really impact their sense of loneliness and social connection in a powerful way.”Friedlander is a freelance writer based in Chicago.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/letters-pandemic-depression-anxiety-help/2020/09/14/47b3bb3a-f3b1-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Toni Tipton-Martin hired as Cook’s Country’s new editor, in a shift she sees as ‘long overdue’,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/09/15/toni-tipton-martin-hired-as-cooks-countrys-new-editor-in-a-shift-she-sees-as-long-overdue/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
For many of its fans America’s Test Kitchen is synonymous with a methodical often science-based approach to cooking as represented by two of its biggest properties the public television series of the same name and its signature Cook’s Illustrated magazine. But the brand has been investing in and evolving another one of its major magazine and television assets Cook’s Country. Tuesday ATK announced that food journalist cookbook author and food historian Toni Tipton-Martin will be the new editor in chief to spearhead that effort beginning in November. Tipton-Martin’s history in food media includes stints at the Cleveland Plain-Dealer where she became the first Black food editor of a major metropolitan daily and the Los Angeles Times where she was a staff writer. She has published two acclaimed volumes focusing on Black foodways and cookbooks “The Jemima Code” in 2015 and “Jubilee” in 2019. [‘We can create our own identities’: A new cookbook celebrates the breadth of African American foodways] Tipton-Martin says the ATK brand has built its reputation on rigorously tested recipes and now she wants to “devote that level of attention to the stories behind the recipes.” “It can be as simple as adding some additional information about the African origins to a dish like chicken Mozambique” she says. “It’s a question of attribution and accurate reporting of the history.” Jack Bishop chief creative officer of America’s Test Kitchen says Tipton-Martin’s background as a storyteller and scholar make her an ideal fit for Cook’s Country which he said is focused on “leading with heart” setting it apart from Cook’s Illustrated’s more “cerebral” approach. Cook’s Country’s updated tagline is “celebrating cooking in America” a subtle but distinct difference from previous branding aimed at “American cooking” says Bishop. Especially through the TV program’s “on the road” segments Tipton-Martin wants to give a “bird’s eye view of what people are cooking at home in places large and small … I’m really excited about using food to tell the story of American cooking at every level.” [Bon Appétit names book-publishing veteran Dawn Davis as top editor] That feels especially relevant in the current political climate which Tipton-Martin would like to approach with a spirit of healing. “I’m going to be living out the philosophy articulated by James Beard. Food is our common ground and that’s been a characteristic of my entire body of work” Tipton-Martin says. “When we break down the stereotypes that divide us we have an incredible opportunity to share our love of food.” Tipton-Martin center pictured with Alexander Smalls and Padma Lakshmi on the set of Top Chef will lead America’s Test Kitchen’s Cook’s Country publication. (Paul Cheney/Bravo/NBCUniversal/Getty Images) In addition to working on its bimonthly 275000-circulation magazine Tipton-Martin will be tasked with developing and even starring in new television and podcast projects which will be able to ramp up more in earnest once coronavirus-related travel restrictions ease. “We’re viewing Toni’s role as very much a public role” Bishop says. Tipton-Martin’s hiring comes at a time when publications especially in food media are reckoning with racial disparities in their staffs and coverage as well as accusations of unequal pay and toxic work environments. Recent months have seen internal and external scrutiny create upheaval at several major outlets including the ousters of Bon Appétit editor in chief Adam Rappoport and Los Angeles Times food editor Peter Meehan both of which occurred following Twitter threads published by Tammie Teclemariam a freelance food and drinks writer. Bon Appétit recently named Dawn Davis one of the few Black women at the upper echelons of the publishing world its new editor in chief. She joins new executive editor Sonia Chopra a food journalist and editor most recently at Vox/Eater on the magazine’s masthead. The Los Angeles Times has yet to name a new permanent food editor. Tipton-Martin will be the first person of color to lead an America’s Test Kitchen publication as editor in chief. The brand’s other two editors in chief are Dan Souza of Cook’s Illustrated and Molly Birnbaum of America’s Test Kitchen Kids. This year ATK announced a plan for increasing diversity on its staff and inclusion in its coverage which sets a goal of increasing the number of BIPOC employees by 50 percent by the end of next year. When current Cook’s Country editor in chief Tucker Shaw announced he was leaving to focus on writing a novel “I viewed this as an opportunity” Bishop says. “We said we were going to do a better job here.” [James Beard was anti-elitist. He would hate the awards that bear his name.] “My appointment is long overdue” Tipton-Martin says. “I would like to inspire the next generation of food journalists. We have lots of people who are doing great food writing and are terrific food essayists” but she also hopes to use the show and overall Cook’s Country vision “to cultivate reportage.” Tipton-Martin had visited ATK’s Boston office in February to talk about “Jubilee” as part of ATK food stylist cast member and podcast host Elle Simone Scott’s work “inviting people in to talk and share their knowledge with us” Bishop says. Then and now Bishop saw the potential for a match. “You meet her and you feel she’s a natural teacher” he says. “Our job is to teach and educate. That’s really what the brand is about.” More from Voraciously: Amid accusations of discrimination Bon Appétit staff vows to ‘dismantle racism’ Bon Appétit video stars leave the Test Kitchen series due to alleged racial discrimination Bon Appétit’s editor resigns after ‘brownface’ photo and allegations of discrimination,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/09/15/toni-tipton-martin-hired-as-cooks-countrys-new-editor-in-a-shift-she-sees-as-long-overdue/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Hurricane Sally sits in the Gulf, but along the coast deadly flood waters are rising.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/09/15/hurricane-sally-biloxi-mobile-floods/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
But it meant as much as 30 inches of rain could fall along the coasts of those states and up to five feet of storm surge could inundate coastal communities. Forecasters said there could be record flooding along rivers in Northwest Florida parts of Alabama and perhaps Georgia.“The slow forward speed is likely to result in a historical rainfall event for the north-central Gulf Coast” the National Hurricane Center posted in an online discussion about the storm Tuesday.Sally’s wobbly movement also makes it hard to predict where it will strike land. On Monday meteorologists predicted it would hit Biloxi Miss. but that changed Tuesday and Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich was relieved.“We’re real thankful that we were spared the storm surge” Gilich said. “Four to six feet they’re predicting. That’s a lot better than seven or 11.”But in Mobile Ala. County Commissioner Merceria Ludgood watched with dread as predictions pointed their way.“We’re telling people that there’s going to be a lot of water” Ludgood said from an emergency management facility where she and other officials planned to ride out the storm. “The ground can only hold so much of it. Don’t wait to leave.”Mobile is a city with thousands of oak trees that could tumble when their root systems are soaked. It is also adorned with rivers canals and the enormous Big Creek Lake that is prone to flooding said Mike Evans deputy director of the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency.Evans said the county has been divided into evacuation zones. Residents south of Interstate 10 as well as those east of Interstate 65 in Mobile Bay and the network of rivers that feed it should get out he said.The county sheriff commissioned a 15-ton military grade vehicle to respond if residents who decide to hunker down are trapped. But Evans hopes it doesn’t come to that. When the hurricane hits public officials emergency personnel included planned to shelter in place.Emergency officials gently asked Mobile County residents to impose on friends and family inland to put them up for a while. Theodore High School where the county established a shelter can usually hold up to a thousand evacuees. But social distancing as a result of the coronavirus pandemic has limited occupation to only 300.Downtown Mobile was mostly empty Tuesday with businesses in the flood-prone area closed in advance of Hurricane Sally. Signs of a hurricane’s approach were a common sight: boarded windows sandbagged doors and streets barricaded in places where water was expected to surge.Hayley’s Bar was one of a few exceptions. Doors were open and three customers enjoyed afternoon drinks. None seemed concerned about the coming storm.“The city floods on like a normal rainy day” said Grace Foster 23. “Here we have rain tropical storms hurricanes. We’re kind of due for a good hurricane.”Foster and the other patrons live within walking distance of Hayley’s. They said they were ready for whatever Sally might bring.“We are all stocked up for covid already so we had a lot of the stuff we need” said Tres Wiggins 28.“I just moved all my plants inside” Foster said “and we stocked up on alcohol.”Heading south toward Dauphin Island Ala. Sally’s effects were more visible Tuesday as floodwaters from Mobile Bay began spilling across roads.Sonya Gunderson 60 was having a ball at a retreat on the island where she traveled from Iowa to meet seven friends who fished the ocean and frolicked on the beach.But Sally chased them off the vulnerable strip of land into a condo in Mobile.On Tuesday she walked in a steady downpour downtown wearing a blue raincoat and carrying a pan a lighter and some candles — supplies borrowed from the property manager in advance of the storm’s impact.“All of our events are canceled” Gunderson said. “We had deep sea fishing dinner on the ocean. Now we’re just playing games.”At a popular fishing spot near Buccaneer Yacht Club Robert Boykin 62 sat with his wife in one of a dozen parked cars looking out over the bay’s unusually choppy waters.“I just hope it doesn’t get too bad because I only stay a mile or two from here” Boykin said.For Boykin and others Sally’s snail-paced approach made it hard to know just when to hunker down.“We’re here looking now” he said. “But as soon as we get home we’re going to be there.”In Biloxi the city’s eight casinos were still temporarily shut after the storm turned east. One casino flashed a sign saying “Sorry.”Since 2005 residents have compared major storms to Hurricane Katrina which pummeled the city with 28 feet of storm surges that are still marked in blue paint on telephone poles.“We got wiped off the face of the Earth” said Karen Parrott 63 as she took an afternoon stroll to the shore with her husband Bill also 63.The couple said they were not worried about Hurricane Sally.“Not after Katrina” she said.Across the Route 110 bridge that links Biloxi to the city of D’Iberville Miss. a pair of friends chatted as the high tide covered picnic tables and seeped into the road. They said they were not expecting much from Sally.“It’s doubtful this late in the season” said Joshua Jackson 27 a construction worker from the community of Vancleave Miss. who stopped to hang out under the bridge on his way home from work in Gulfport Miss.But the Biloxi mayor — a lifelong resident — said he was not prepared to declare storm season over.“Who knows?” Gilich said about it noting that in his State of the City address in January he had predicted a great year ahead. “Don’t you just feel really good about 2020?” he recalled saying in his speech.“Boy was I wrong” he said with an eye roll. “I’m not going to say that again."In Northwest Florida Escambia and Santa Rosa county officials imposed voluntary evacuation orders for coastal and low-lying areas urging vulnerable residents to seek higher ground.“Flooding is one of the most serious concerns we have with this storm” Escambia County Emergency Manager Eric Gilmore said during a Tuesday afternoon news conference. “The amount of rain and storm surge will make this a historic event."The brand-new Pensacola Bay Bridge one of only two evacuation routes off Santa Rosa Island and Pensacola Beach was shut down Tuesday when a barge operated by a state contractor collided with the structure.Local officials suspended tolls for the nearby Garcon Point Bridge to make it easier for residents to evacuate.On the other side of Escambia Bay in downtown Pensacola about 100 residents had hunkered down at a local civic center turned storm shelter by midafternoon.Michael Kimberl director of the Alfred Washburn Center which serves the homeless spent much of the last 24 hours ferrying the homeless to the civic center.“I’ve been driving shuttle most of the afternoon and last night trying to get people to shelters” said Kimberl who dropped off about 30 people there by 3 p.m. Tuesday.Kimberl worried he wouldn’t be able to reach all of the area’s homeless before the storm made landfall and felt local authorities were partially to blame for waiting too long to announce local shelter openings.“We had about 100 people at the center yesterday afternoon” he said. “Had I known about the shelter before we closed I could have sent them there.”Cusick reported from Mobile Sacchetti reported from Biloxi Strickland reported from Pensacola and Fears reported from D.C.

Opinion | Thanks to the Trump administration, one QAnon theory is panning out,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/trump-has-exposed-deep-state-it-is-him/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Neither does it seem to be the case that Austin Steinbart a man many once believed to be “Q” had prophetic insight into the inner workings of the U.S. government because he received messages from his future self through quantum computing. Steinbart recently jailed for violating the terms of his pre-trial release on extortion charges had in his possession a prosthetic penis called a “Whizzinator” used for falsifying drug tests the Daily Beast’s Will Sommer reports.Nor was Hillary Clinton imprisoned in October 2017 as Q had promised — though it cannot be ruled out that the real Clinton as some QAnon adherents hold was indeed arrested and the one walking free today is a clone.The world is likewise yet to see evidence that the U.S. government is run by reptilian aliens (Stephen Miller aside) that many in the federal government worship Satan that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is a CIA puppet or that liberal elites stay young by drinking a substance called “adrenochrome” that they derive from the blood of children they hold in captivity as part of a pedophilia ring.But in one respect QAnon theory is panning out. There is indeed a sinister cabal trying to manipulate the U.S. government in ways that harm the American people.It is called the Trump administration.On Sunday Michael Caputo an assistant secretary of public affairs for the Department of Health and Human Services and a key manager of the Trump administration’s public messaging about the pandemic declared on Facebook Live that government scientists were engaging in “sedition” with the pandemic and that armed left-wing hit squads were preparing for a post-election insurrection. As the New York Times and others reported Caputo also said his “mental health has definitely failed” and he was seeing “shadows on the ceiling in my apartment there alone shadows are so long.” He apologized to colleagues on Tuesday.Last Thursday Roger Stone a longtime Trump confidant whose prison sentence was commuted after he offered to help with Trump’s reelection said federal marshals should seize and discard election ballots in Nevada that Justice Department officers should physically block people from voting and that if Trump loses he should consider declaring martial law and arresting Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg Apple’s Tim Cook the Clintons former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and the staff of the Daily Beast.And Trump himself on Monday visiting the fire-ravaged West Coast dismissed the very notion that climate change exists saying “I don’t think science knows” and “it’ll start getting cooler — you just you just watch.” He previously said the “deep state” was slowing vaccine progress at the Food and Drug Administration.All fit neatly with key QAnon tenets that scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have fueled the pandemic to harm Trump that Trump will arrest and execute political opponents based on now-secret indictments in an operation called the “Storm” and that climate change is a hoax designed to enrich left-wing interests.This follows Trump’s embrace of QAnon adherents last month as “people that love our country” and the many times he and those around him have shared or promoted QAnon-linked accounts and ideas on social media or invited QAnon personalities to the White House. In July former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn posted a video of himself reciting a QAnon oath. Twenty-one QAnon adherents will be representing the Republican Party on congressional ballots in November Media Matters reports.Forgive my conspiracy theorizing but it sounds as though QAnon has performed a secret coup of its own. Et tu Q?Devotees of QAnon fantasies have done real-world damage. Authorities in Oregon are battling not just wildfires but a rash of calls to 911 dispatchers claiming the Q-promoted falsehood that “antifa” militants had set the forest fires. As Yahoo News reported the FBI warned that QAnon theories will at times inspire “criminal or violent acts.” QAnon adherents have allegedly committed crimes coast to coast.From the anonymity of the Dark Web QAnon offers something for every suspicious mind. It embraces anti-Semites anti-vaxxers 9/11 truthers and anybody who believes the military Democrats the media Hollywood the Catholic Church banks or industry are perpetrating murders trafficking enslavement or a coup.There has always been such paranoia. The difference now is it has been validated by the president and his family appointees and advisers. Trump has exposed the deep state and it is him.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/trump-has-exposed-deep-state-it-is-him/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

‘The end of an innocent world’: An oral history of the first National Book Festival, which debuted three days before 9/11,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/national-book-festival-anniversary/2020/09/14/54d3155c-f37c-11ea-bc45-e5d48ab44b9f_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The festival’s 20th installment is somewhat bittersweet: Because of the coronavirus pandemic the 2020 National Book Festival will be an online-only experience running from Sept. 25-27. Though if one thing is clear from that first year it’s that the festival can outlast even the most cataclysmic news events and come out stronger on the other side.Here’s an oral history of the debut event as told by participating authors and organizers.Bush: Dr. (James) Billington (then-librarian of Congress) was the one who called me and said “Why don’t we do a national festival?” We met early on that spring after we had moved to the White House and started working on it. The Library of Congress did a lot of the work.John Y. Cole the library’s historian and founding director of its Center for the Book: From the beginning it was clear that this was a natural fit for the library. And we knew it had to be open to the public and free to attend. We never wanted to have anything commercial about it so we raised the private money. It also had to be nonpartisan.Author Gail Tsukiyama: It was a wonderful thing the first lady’s love of books — and it transcended politics. That’s what books do: transcend everything.Marie Arana then-editor of The Washington Post’s Book World and current literary director of the festival: I called Jim Billington and said “We want in” and The Washington Post became the first charter sponsor of the book festival. I had a lot of contact with authors at the time so I could bring some on but it was a little like you had to persuade people in the beginning.Tsukiyama: My first thought was how lucky! This whole new festival and they’re asking you? And then I thought oh my God I get to go to Washington.Within six months — half of what it now takes to plan the event — it was go time. On Friday Sept. 7 the weekend kicked off with a black-tie dinner at the Library of Congress.Cole: If you know the Great Hall at the library you know there are stairs coming down from the overlook over the Main Reading Room. One of the military bands was playing and suddenly the spotlights shone and way up high Mrs. Bush and the president came out of one set of doors. And then Mr. and Mrs. Billington came down the other way from three stories up.Author Thomas Mallon: It was quite elaborate and very well-attended politically. You saw a lot of star power from the administration.Turow: Every Cabinet member save one — which was the protocol at that time — was in attendance. Of course it would be virtually impossible to stage an event like that now. It was probably the last time there was that kind of steak dinner-like gathering with all the Cabinet members and their families and the president and his family in the same room.Early Saturday Bush hosted a White House breakfast for the authors that many recall as an intimate opportunity to get to know each other more so than they had experienced at other festivals.Billy Collins poet laureate from 2001-2003: There was this incredible spread — everything you could possibly think of to eat not just for breakfast but any meal. And I noticed there was instant replenishment. If I took a muffin I’d turn around and look back and it’d be replaced. So at the end of the brunch it looked like no one had touched anything.Author Alice McDermott: There was something spine-tingling and patriotic having the White House as the place that welcomed all the writers. We were all sort of starry-eyed and Gail Tsukiyama and I were both there with our mothers. We felt like giggling teenagers.Tsukiyama: I’m glad she remembers that. At a festival as large and grand as the National Book Festival writers get to meet other writers they admire. The author I was thrilled to meet was Alice McDermott.Bush: That weekend friends of mine — many of them very active in the Texas Book Festival — came and stayed at the White House. So we had a great big White House party which is the most fun kind.McDermott: Laura Bush was great. She was so gracious and she had all her friends there and I remember them all sort of working the room and making sure everybody felt at home.After breakfast trolleys delivered participants to the Mall. During the festival more than 60 authors across a variety of genres gave talks on the east lawn of the Capitol building and in the library’s Jefferson and Madison buildings.Cole: There was an abundance of enthusiasm that day. I knew it would be successful whatever happened but I didn’t know exactly what would happen. I worried and paced the whole festival and never thought to listen.McDermott: There was a small-town carnival feel to having it outside. There were lots of kids and characters in book-related costumes wandering around and there were a lot of balloons.Collins: It was a series of tents and you could wander from tent to tent for different readings. There were more signing tables than I’d ever seen before.Bush: I went to everything. I was there with all my houseguests and we went tent to tent on the mall. Larry L. King was there . . . He’s the one who did “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” and I thought that was funny to have him there with us.Tsukiyama: I was terrified. It was a big white tent outside the Capitol and there were a couple hundred chairs and my first thought was what if they’re all empty? Because that was a lot of chairs! But something really wonderful about the National Book Festival is that the seats fill up. People come.Collins: It was the first time I spoke publicly about a project I had just started as poet laureate. It was called Poetry 180 and it featured 180 poems that were contemporary and cool. I introduced the program and there were nine or 10 high school kids from D.C. who each got up and read a poem that they had picked off the website. Some of them were very nervous of course. They were reading from a page they had printed out and some of the pages were kind of shaking.Arana: Something we didn’t realize until we moved inside was that the noise level on the Mall was difficult. You could hear from one tent to another so you might be delivering a very serious disposition on death and war and then you have this tent next to you roaring with laughter.Peter Slen executive producer of Book TV on C-SPAN2 which has aired live from the festival since its inception: That first undertaking was in a word huge. We consider the National Book Festival to be our Super Bowl — it’s in our backyard and it’s our topics. What you saw that day were author talks author interviews and author call-in programs.Author Walter Mosley: I was being interviewed (on Book TV) and there were lots of people outside listening to us talk. A call came in from a guy who wanted to ask me a question. And he says “I’m Taj Mahal.” The woman interviewing me said “Oh is he a friend of yours?” And I said “No he’s Taj Mahal!” One of the major blues musicians of his generation. It was pretty wild and I know it was him because I’ve been in touch with him since then.Cole: I thought it would be a great idea to have the book signings in the library’s Great Hall. Well it turned out it was absolutely jammed. We had no idea we would have so many people coming. So what we did was we moved a lot of those tables out on the lawn — but that caused nothing but chaos.Turow: I remember people standing in line for more than two hours to get signed books.Author Robin Cook: During one of my book signings one of my old girlfriends from college showed up to get a signature. It was really fun to see her; we hadn’t had any sort of contact for 30 years.Mallon: I remember it vividly. Liz Carpenter who was Lady Bird Johnson’s press secretary was there on her little motorized cart. Kinky Friedman the Texas musician was there. I remember David McCullough Tom Brokaw and John Hope Franklin the great African American historian.Cole: At the end of the day this wonderful children’s author Steven Kellogg had a train to catch and we had to cut off his line around 5:30. This festival was supposed to end at 5 but nobody wanted to leave. Steven stood up and people said “Are you going to come back?” And he said “John I’ll come back if you invite me.” And he did. It was jubilation all day but then three days later once 9/11 came I thought well we’re not going to have another festival.Historian Michael Beschloss: Mrs. Bush was the architect of all this. I didn’t speak to her that day but I saw her at a little bit of a distance and she was walking through the crowd I think between only two Secret Service agents. Again it underscored this air of informality and no huge need for security. And within three days we were living in a different world.Arana: It was a deliciously innocent moment and then suddenly everything changed.McDermott: It really does seem like it was from another age like an 1800s town picnic. It was that sense of will we ever be that free and innocent again? And I guess we weren’t.On Sept. 11 “I remember thinking the sun was shining the same way it was the day of the book festival” Beschloss notes. The future of the festival appeared to be in limbo as the country’s priorities shifted. In an October editorial in American Libraries magazine editor Leonard Kniffel wrote that it seemed “like a sad memory a day that marked not a new start but the end of an innocent world that showed itself on the Capitol lawn for that one last safe and friendly day.”Cole: But Mrs. Bush never wavered in her determination to proceed. And now of course it’s the most successful public event ever staged by the Library of Congress and has grown tremendously.Bush: I knew we would do it again. I do think people sort of looked up into the sky the next year slightly nervous over it. But I knew we’d keep doing it.Angela Haupt is a freelance writer and full-time health editor in D.C.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/national-book-festival-anniversary/2020/09/14/54d3155c-f37c-11ea-bc45-e5d48ab44b9f_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Review | Sarah Shun-lien Bynum’s ‘Likes’ brilliantly captures our current moment,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/sarah-shun-lien-bynums-likes-brilliantly-captures-our-current-moment/2020/09/15/283df00e-f767-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Even the title story reminds us that fairy tales continue to exist: A father peers into the world of his daughter’s Instagram where girls attempt to fashion stories out of incomprehensible images. “New Instagram post: a peeled-off pair of ballet tights splayed on the white tiles of a bathroom floor.”“Likes” may cause some discomfort. Girls with their swift and mysterious pubescent metamorphoses unsettle themselves their parents and society.But it’s all part of Shun-lien Bynum’s breadcrumb path that starts with childhood and ends with womanhood. She’s tracing seasons in the lives of female characters from the early years in which they attend Waldorf School fairs replete with elves fairies and compostable lemonade cups through middle-school nicknames and midlife sadness. She’s not tracing them in a linear fashion; the stories each take place in specific lives and milieus.“Tell Me My Name” the second story in the book focuses on happily settled Los Angeles lesbians who live next door to once-famous Manhattan club icon Betti Pérez a dead ringer for Dita von Teese or perhaps Debbi Mazar: “She has arching eyebrows and the smallest possible pores flat red lipstick. . . . She must be at least forty-five years old! You’d never know it because her skin is amazing.”Betti’s looks are important to this story especially at a point where the unnamed narrator sees relief “do something strange to Betti’s face. For the first time I see a trace of looseness there . . . the slight heaviness under her jaw or how her foundation lies dustily on top of her skin.” If women are the central characters in “Likes” time is the villain that stalks them: The seconds in which a mother turns away from her little girl. The long wait for a king to die. A longed-for creative residency turned sour the momentary dopamine hits of Instagram attention the slow currying of favor to gain attention from a man.Shun-lien Bynum allows her characters to believe they’ve seen the truth but shows her readers that the characters — like us — rarely get it right. “Likes” is a short-story collection you should read slowly but it’s so good each story at such a high-wire level that you’ll wind up tearing through it and wishing for more.Bethanne Patrick is the editor most recently of “The Books That Changed My Life: Reflections by 100 Authors Actors Musicians and Other Remarkable People.”LikesFarrar Straus and Giroux. 240 pp. $26,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/sarah-shun-lien-bynums-likes-brilliantly-captures-our-current-moment/2020/09/15/283df00e-f767-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Biden visits Florida as Democrats worry about his standing in the state,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-latinos-veterans-florida/2020/09/15/6e466eea-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“Donald Trump has done nothing but assault the dignity of Hispanic families over and over and over and over again” Biden said in comments marking the start of National Hispanic Heritage Month. “It’s wrong.”He cast himself as an alternative who would stand up for Latinos and help improve their lives and he nodded to their crucial role in the upcoming election. “More than any other time the Hispanic community and the Latino community hold in the palm of their hand the destiny of this country” Biden said.The remarks were part of an urgent push to shore up his support among Latino voters. They came amid increasingly vocal criticism from Latino leaders that the Biden campaign’s outreach to their community has been lackluster which they say could potentially cost him badly on Election Day.In addition to visiting Kissimmee a community to which many residents of Puerto Rico moved after Hurricane Maria devastated the island Biden unveiled a plan to create a federal working group for Puerto Rico to help with recovery efforts and economic advancement. The plan calls for accelerating access to reconstruction funding forgiving disaster relief loans to municipalities and bolstering local businesses.He also sat down for an interview with Jose Diaz-Balart of Telemundo his first one-on-one session with a national Spanish-language network since clinching the nomination.Biden voiced support for Puerto Rican statehood saying it would be the most “effective means of ensuring the residents of Puerto Rico are treated equally.” But he added “the people of Puerto Rico must decide.” Puerto Rico will have statehood a referendum on its ballot in November.Earlier in the day Biden met with veterans highlighting an area where he has been able to siphon support from Trump in part because many elderly voters are unhappy with the president’s handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic. In addressing Latinos in contrast Biden was trying to stem Trump’s gains among a traditionally Democratic group.“In my view based on reports from interviews President Trump has proven he’s unfit to hold the office of the presidency time and again” Biden said at a roundtable with veterans and military families in Tampa. “But nowhere are his faults more glaring and more offensive to me at least than when it comes to his denigration of our service members.”In criticizing Trump Biden referred to his late son Beau Biden who served in Iraq and died of cancer in 2015.“He’s gone now — but he was no sucker” Biden said.Biden is favored to win the Latino vote — in Florida and nationally — but some recent polls show his margins lagging behind Hillary Clinton’s support from Latinos in 2016 and speaking to reporters Tuesday he acknowledged that he has work to do.“Look what I have to do is make the case why it will be so much better for the Hispanic community the Latino community if in fact Trump is no longer president” Biden told reporters. That case he added includes “education health care immigration the whole notion of dealing with covid in a way that doesn’t so damage the Hispanic community which is hurt very badly much worse than the Caucasian community.”He suggested that Trump is doing little to help pass legislation that could benefit Latino and other voters. “He should get off the damn golf course and sit down in the Oval Office and sit with both Republicans and Democrats and get something done” Biden said.Trump and his supporters argue that his presidency has been highly beneficial for Latinos especially when in job creation an assertion that sidesteps the pandemic’s significant economic impact on minority communities.On Tuesday Trump’s allies sought to make the case that Democrats pose as friends of Latinos but do little to help then. Former Puerto Rico attorney general Jose Fuentes accused Biden of viewing the Latino community as a “political prop.”Regarding polls suggesting that Biden has ground to make up in the Latino community activists and leaders cite several reasons. They note a lingering displeasure with Barack Obama’s deportation policies a lack of detail in Biden’s own immigration plans an inner circle that lacks a large number of Latinos and a perception that Biden’s campaign has placed a priority on attracting White suburbanites and African Americans rather than courting Latinos.Biden’s campaign has defended his efforts saying the former vice president is pursuing a diverse electoral coalition like the one that rallied behind Obama in 2008 and 2012. Biden’s running mate Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has spoken or met several times with Latino groups.On the bright side for Biden he appears to be eating into Trump’s once dominant advantage among older voters and on Tuesday he slammed Trump over his talk of a payroll tax cut framing such a move as a danger to Social Security.“It’s just absolutely foolish. What we should be is increasing Social Security for people” Biden said in an interview with WFLA TV in Tampa.In a state with many retirees Biden’s strength with the group has put him in a position to win and polls suggest Florida is now a toss-up. With 29 electoral votes it is the largest true battleground and Trump’s path to victory narrows considerably if Biden can capture it. Trump narrowly won the state in 2016.Biden chose Central Florida for his first big Florida trip a battleground area with a large Puerto Rican population. Puerto Rican voters have tended to favor Democrats and Biden is wagering that he can continue that trend.In contrast Biden did not travel Tuesday to South Florida where there are signs he is struggling with the Cuban American community.Republicans have unleashed an onslaught of GOP attacks branding Democrats as socialists and that appears to have had some effect despite Biden’s longtime political identity as a centrist.Further roiling the political waters in Florida former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg recently promised to spend $100 million to bolster Biden in the state. A significant amount of that will go toward Spanish-language advertising.In his speech Biden hardly mentioned immigration policy — a polarizing issue but one that is important to many Latino voters — saying only that he would pursue a system that would “treat people with dignity and is true to American values.”Biden was introduced by several Latinos stars including Puerto Rican musical artists Ricky Martin and Luis Fonsi.“I just have one thing to say” Biden said after Fonsi introduced him. He pulled out his phone and played his hit single “Despacito” as he bobbed and swayed with a smile.Felicia Sonmez contributed to this report.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-latinos-veterans-florida/2020/09/15/6e466eea-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
What Apple didn’t announce: An iPhone 12,headline,https://washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/15/iphone12-apple-event/?tid=pm_pop&itid=pm_pop,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The omission isn’t a surprise but it’s still unusual. For a company that built its brand on innovation Apple has become pretty predictable. Every fall it announces its latest iPhones. The company has announced new iPhones every September since 2012. The year prior in 2011 the iPhone 4s was announced in October.However Apple has delayed the release of its phones before most recently the iPhone X which wasn’t in stores until November.When is the iPhone 12 coming?Analysts expect the new phones to be announced in October at the earliest. Apple confirmed that the iPhone would be late on an earnings call back in July when Luca Maestri the company’s chief financial officer said iPhone supply was going to be available a few weeks later than usual.A month might not seem like a big deal but Apple wants all its new products released and in stock ahead of the holiday rush. That should be especially true if that rush could be dampened by fewer people shopping in stores and families not having holiday gatherings because of the novel coronavirus.A month seems long. What am I even waiting for?Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models ranging in size from 5.4 to 6.7 inches. If they follow Apple’s most recent naming conventions — and the overused trend of slapping “Max” and “Pro” on the end of every product name — we could get an iPhone 12 iPhone 12 Max iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Minor upgrades could include tweaks to the exterior design and better cameras including a depth-sensing back camera. As for design the new iPad Air that Apple announced Tuesday has flat edges which could be a sign of what’s to come on any new iPhones.The main addition will likely be support for 5G the cellular network that promises lightning-fast download and upload speeds ... eventually.Every new iPhone needs one big enticing feature to persuade people to give up the still-functioning iPhone they bought two or so years ago. The iPhone 11 for example added an impressive lowlight mode and tried to make “slofies” happen. IPhone sales have been slowing for years thanks to an end to carrier subsidies and Apple offering inexpensive battery replacements. But with so many people stuck at home and connecting happily over their WiFi its unclear whether 5G will be the jolt to sales Apple wants.Why is it delayed? This is 2020. Up is down the country is simultaneously on fire and fending off hurricanes. Apple CEO Tim Cook is presenting new products to an invisible audience and we’re still in the throes of a pandemic that has hit Apple sales stores and production.Apple warned investors that the virus was disrupting production back in February. In addition to issues with its supply chain much of Apple’s U.S. staff has been working from home and its stores worldwide have had to shut down although many have reopened with new restrictions.Fine no iPhone 12 today. What can I buy soon?Apple announced two new Apple Watches including a lower-cost Apple Watch SE and the Apple Watch Series 6 which can measure blood oxygen levels. Both will be available September 18. A new 8th generation iPad will start at $329 and also be out at the end of week. The $599 and up iPad Air however isn’t coming until some time in October.Additionally sometime before the end of 2020 Apple says you’ll be able to sign up for the new Fitness+ service which will cost $10 a month. Its all-in-one Apple One bundle of various services is coming this fall starting at $15 a month.And the company already released a new phone earlier this year the lower-cost iPhone SE. An update to its last beloved iPhone SE cherished for being small enough to fit into the smallest pocket and sturdy enough to open a beer the new SE is only the same in name and price range.For a quick hit of newness the latest operating systems will be available tomorrow including the new iOS.Do you absolutely have to get something that can connect to 5G right this second? Well Veruca Salt Samsung and OnePlus are here for you and already sell their own 5G phones. The 5G networks however still have some catching up to do.,body,https://washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/15/iphone12-apple-event/?tid=pm_pop&itid=pm_pop,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Opinion | Protests and Trump rallies both carry covid-19 risks. But there’s a reason Trump’s rallies are worse.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/protests-and-trump-rallies-both-carry-covid-19-risks-but-theres-a-reason-trumps-rallies-are-worse/2020/09/15/a677ddde-f791-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
But there is one key difference between social justice protests and Trump rallies: Those attending BLM protests by and large grasp the danger and are motivated to reduce their risk while a large share of those attending Trump rallies deny that there is a danger at all.I had a patient a woman in her 60s with chronic medical conditions who told me she followed covid-19 precautions to the point that she only left her house once a day to take a walk. She had all of her groceries delivered and she didn’t even see her grandchildren because they attended day care. Yet she felt strongly that she needed take part in an anti-racism protest. She’d lost family members to police brutality and she was willing to risk her life to show her commitment to the movement.As her doctor I couldn’t recommend that she participate in an activity that could compromise her health. But since she was going no matter what it was my job to help her stay as safe as possible.This is the public health concept of harm reduction. Protesting involves risk but she could still substantially reduce that risk by being outdoors wearing a mask avoiding dense crowds limiting her time there and not using public transportation. My patient chose a protest within walking distance of her house. She made sure to stay at the outer edge of the crowd where she was able to maintain a six-foot distance from others most of the time.These harm-reduction opportunities continue after an event ends and participants return to their homes. My patient lived alone but at her protest those who live with others were instructed to self-quarantine for at least five days and then get tested. During the protests organizers followed public health guidance to educate participants about how to protect themselves and others. Many cities have helped by offering free testing for protesters.Not everyone follows every guideline of course but overall such harm-reduction practices appear to have worked. A research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research examined patterns of spread in more than 300 major cities and found “no evidence that net covid-19 case growth differentially rose following the onset of Black Lives Matter protests.”Where are the harm-reduction practices at Trump’s rallies? The most recent events in Nevada and Arizona have been held indoors. Compared with those outdoors indoor gatherings could increase the risk of transmission by 18 to 19 times. Many attendees appeared to not wear masks. Some rallygoers in Michigan called covid-19 a “fake pandemic” and spoke about mask-wearing as an infringement on their rights. Trump himself was not wearing a mask at the rallies. He used his platform to mock public health practices.It seems reasonable then to worry that many attendees engage in other risky behaviors such as hugging and shaking hands. Do they participate in higher-transmission activities before and after rallies such as going to tightly packed bars and indoor restaurants? When they return to home do they ignore guidance to self-quarantine and get tested?And that’s the key difference between social justice protests and Trump’s political rallies. This is what public health experts should counter with when we come under fire for appearing to support one cause over the other. It’s not our job to judge why people are at an event but it is our duty to explain — based on science — what makes one event higher-risk than another.To be clear from an epidemiological perspective there shouldn’t be any mass gatherings during a pandemic. But let’s not engage in false equivalencies. The reason Trump’s rallies are more dangerous than social justice protests has nothing to do with the purpose of the gatherings and everything to do with the behavior of organizers and participants.The distinction is this: Are attendees going in spite of the risk or in defiance of it?,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/protests-and-trump-rallies-both-carry-covid-19-risks-but-theres-a-reason-trumps-rallies-are-worse/2020/09/15/a677ddde-f791-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Top 10 summer recipes: Our readers’ favorites are meatless, nostalgic and quick,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/09/12/top-10-summer-recipes-our-readers-favorites-are-meatless-nostalgic-and-quick/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Through what readers have told us and what we’ve seen we know that people are cooking more at home these days — perhaps more than they’ve ever been used to. At the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic we saw surges in popularity for certain ingredients and recipes. Beans were at the very top. Ditto baked goods especially bread and especially sourdough. As travel restrictions and self-isolating continued into the summer people remained invested in those. But we also saw a bit more diversity in the kinds of recipes readers like you were clicking on and making. [From 2019: Hold on to summer a bit longer with our 10 most popular recipes of the season] Like just about any data set there are multiple ways to interpret why these recipes surged into the top 10 this summer. I’m going to take a stab at it anyway. First … vegetables! You’ll notice that all but one recipe here is meatless. That is impressive to say the least. Whether it’s because of budget logistics (fewer trips to the store) ethics (concerns about working conditions in meat processing plants) or a seasonal preference for produce these recipes show that interest in vegetarian-friendly fare is high. We tend to find that dishes cooked in certain pieces of equipment resonate with readers too. There are not one but two Instant Pot recipes. On the opposite end of the spectrum you’ll see a hash made in a cast-iron skillet a proven reader favorite. Nostalgia goes over well. See the diner-inspired pie or retro one-pot braise. A good number of these recipes fall into the quick and easy category. A few — boba naan — indicate people are willing to use the time at home to try something completely new particularly if it can replicate a food they’re used to having elsewhere.

Hazardous smoke from wildfires continues to smother West Coast,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/thick-hazardous-smoke-from-wildfires-to-continue-to-smother-west-coast/2020/09/15/908d3540-f797-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has extended an air-quality advisory through noon Thursday as several cities in the state reached their highest-ever-recorded air-quality index ratings during the past week. The state already has seen a significant increase in emergency room visits for smoke-related respiratory conditions.Sarah Present a deputy tri-county health officer for the Portland metro region warned residents in a video message on Tuesday that they should stay indoors.“This air can worsen asthma or COPD” she said. “It can lead to heart attacks irregular heart rhythms and even death.”“It is so bad that you can likely smell it inside your house and in some areas the air quality is so hazardous it is off the charts of the EPA’s rating scale” she said. “What this means is you should not go outside.”The smoke that the wildfires in the American West has sent skyward has traveled across the country causing a milky-orange haze and a dimmed sun as far east as D.C. The smoke carried along by the jet stream will linger on the East Coast through at least Thursday promising surreal skies. Effects on the ground are expected to be minimal.Here in Oregon the unusual wildfires have displaced tens of thousands of residents and have left at least eight people dead and at about 16 people missing. There have been approximately 25 deaths in California.Lower temperatures and higher humidity have allowed the more than 8600 firefighters to make progress on the 30 large wildfires spreading across nearly 1.7 million acres in Oregon and Washington state fire officials said Tuesday. Some of those fires continued to grow while at least one the Almeda Fire that ravaged communities in southern Oregon reached 100 percent containment a rare victory in what has been an alarmingly busy fire season at its outset.“We now find ourselves one week into this and without question our state has been pushed to its limits” Gov. Kate Brown (D) said during a news conference Monday. “As we look toward the next few days my firefighting teams tell me they are optimistic that cooler weather coming toward the end of this week will be a tremendous help.”In California more than 16600 firefighters continued to face off against 25 major wildfires across the state. The blazes in California have burned more than 3.2 million acres and destroyed more than 4200 structures according to state fire authorities.A cooling trend in California has helped fire crews in the state but gusty winds have allowed fires to pick up in the north and along the Sierra said Daniel Berlant assistant deputy director of Cal Fire. Those wind gusts are expected to continue through at least Thursday.More than 1145 homes have been destroyed in Oregon and 3185 residents remained in shelters provided by the Red Cross as of Tuesday. Many more are displaced from their homes and waiting for evacuation orders to lift.While officials on Monday had said 10 people were reported dead in Oregon the state medical examiner later determined that two of those fatalities were unrelated to the fires bringing the death toll down to eight. The two subtractions were identified as animal remains.On Tuesday the state began consolidating its efforts to identify and report fatalities in a single mobile morgue the state’s Office of Emergency Management said.About one-tenth of an inch of rain fell along the Oregon coast on Tuesday bringing substantial improvements in visibility there said Daniel Hartsock a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Portland. Still satellite imagery showed smoke lingering over the Willamette Valley and Columbia River Gorge with smoke moving north from the fires in California. Forecasts predict the first “big rain” will arrive in the valley by Thursday afternoon Hartsock said.But Doug Grafe chief of fire protection at the Oregon Department of Forestry said the rain could come with some lightning and thunderstorms in the east which could ignite additional fires.Livingston reported from Washington.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/thick-hazardous-smoke-from-wildfires-to-continue-to-smother-west-coast/2020/09/15/908d3540-f797-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Louisville agrees to $12 million payout and policing changes in agreement with family of Breonna Taylor, killed in police raid,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/15/breonnataylorlouisvillesettlement/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The settlement which follows a wrongful-death lawsuit that Taylor’s family filed in May requires police commanders to approve all search warrant applications that are submitted to a judge said Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer (D) during a news conference Tuesday afternoon. Louisville police will also have to conduct extensive risk assessments before applying for a warrant.At least two officers now will be required to have their body cameras turned on when money seized during an investigation is impounded being counted or processed Fischer said. And in an effort to bolster the police department’s ties to the community officers will be given up to two hours per week of paid time for community service and the department will explore incentives for officers to live within certain low-income areas of the city.The city also has agreed to hire more mental health experts and pair them up with officers who respond to calls Fischer said.“This settlement is of mutual interest” said Sam Aguiar an attorney for the Taylor family in an interview Tuesday. “The city was able to afford this level of justice and Breonna Taylor’s mother has been adamant from day one that reform was needed to reduce the likelihood that no other family has to endure this type of tragedy.”The settlement follows weeks of private talks between the two parties Aguiar said.“This is probably the largest settlement for police misconduct in the history of Louisville and includes substantial police reform as well” he said.The settlement does not include an admission of wrongdoing by the city or the police officers involved in the raid Fischer said. Lonita Baker another attorney for the Taylor family said her clients did not plan to file additional lawsuits.“Today alone is not enough” said Jefferson County Attorney Mike O’Connell. “I hope this agreement is the next step in bringing a more just Louisville. A more just Louisville is the medicine we need to heal.”Settlement amounts in fatal police shootings vary widely. In a 2015 Washington Post account of awards in civil lawsuits payouts ranged from $7500 to $8.5 million. Last year the city of Minneapolis settled a lawsuit with the family of 40-year-old Justine Ruszczyk Damond who was shot by an officer after calling 911 about a possible crime for $20 million.Some of the highest-profile deaths in police custody in recent years have resulted in settlements around $6 million. New York City in 2015 resolved a lawsuit with the family of Eric Garner an unarmed Black man who died after being put in a police chokehold for $5.9 million. Baltimore agreed to pay $6.4 million to the family of Freddie Gray who died a week after suffering a severe spinal injury while handcuffed in a police van. And the city of Cleveland settled a lawsuit with the family of 12-year-old Tamir Rice who was shot while playing with a toy gun in a park for $6 million in 2016.Louisville’s settlement with Taylor’s family will not affect the ongoing investigation by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R) of whether the officers who raided Taylor’s apartment should face criminal charges stemming from her death. The Justice Department is also investigating the case.The Taylor family attorneys signaled they would continue their demands that criminal charges be filed. Attorney Benjamin Crump called on the state attorney general to charge the officers involved in the raid “immediately this week” with “at the very minimum second-degree manslaughter charges.”“Justice for Breonna Taylor is multilayered” Baker added. “What we were able to accomplish today through the civil settlement against the officers is tremendous but it is only a portion of a single layer.”Activists who have been protesting Taylor’s death for months said they too would keep calling for criminal charges.“No amount of money will bring back Breonna Taylor. We see this settlement as the bare minimum that one can do ” Until Freedom a New York-based group that has been heavily involved in making Taylor’s case a defining symbol of the racial justice movement said in a statement. “True justice is not served with cash settlements. … We need accountability. We need justice.”At the news conference Until Freedom co-founder Tamika Mallory demanded that Fischer fire all of the officers involved in Taylor’s killing if Cameron’s office does not indict them. Fischer declined to make that promise.Experts meanwhile expressed skepticism that the announced policing overhauls were as significant as officials portrayed them to be.Geoffrey P. Alpert a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina said he was surprised that Louisville police did not already require commanders to approve warrants and provide incentives for officers to live in the city. Those policies are common practices in police departments across the country he said.“If they’ve never had that in Louisville this is going to be a big improvement” said Alpert who is also a co-author of “Evaluating Police Uses of Force.” “This is going to be meaningful. It’s just shocking or a shame that this is new to Louisville.”Eugene O’Donnell a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice said he doubts that the changes in how search warrants are carried out will make people safer in police raids. He said the best solution is for police agencies to execute fewer search warrants especially when they deal with nonviolent crimes such as drug investigations.“You can candidly have a conversation with the community and say ‘Those days are over and we don’t do that anymore’” O’Donnell said. “Going into a stranger’s home who may have a firearm is going to be dangerous especially in this environment where policing is three times as hard.”O’Donnell added that a reform-minded police department should be looking for ways to reduce “physical-force policing.” He said the public and increasingly police themselves are seeking out solutions that involve fewer face-to-face encounters between officers and suspects.“People are demanding an end to violence … and a lot less policing” O’Donnell said. “If you know who these people are you can identify them you can submit evidence to court you can ask them to surrender and seek their appearance.”In the eyes of Phillip Atiba Goff co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Center for Policing Equity Louisville’s policing changes address bureaucratic issues but fail to confront deeper problems in law enforcement’s mission. He said Louisville’s policing overhauls wrongly treat Taylor’s death as a tragic mistake in a mostly functional system.“What do you say then to the young Black man or woman young trans woman who says ‘I don’t think this is an error. I think this is baked into how and why law enforcement operates’?” Goff said. “This set of solutions has nothing to say to that person.”Chanelle Helm a lead organizer for Black Lives Matter Louisville said protests are still occurring in the city nearly every day and Tuesday’s settlement will do nothing to slow them. Helm said Taylor’s death has now come to represent the broader fight for racial justice and many of those issues have still not been addressed.“I think [Taylor’s] legal team feels like they have gone as far as they can go” said Helm 40 who is Black. “But for us on the front lines who are fighting to defund the police fighting for our neighborhoods and fighting for justice. ... We know this fight is not over.”Taylor was killed March 13 when plainclothes police officers carried out a “no-knock” search warrant at her home shortly after midnight as part of a drug investigation. Taylor was asleep at the time according to the family lawsuit.Her boyfriend Kenneth Walker 27 who was also at the apartment fired a shot with a gun he legally owned and later said he thought the officers were intruders. The officers shot back and Taylor was struck five times.The officers said they identified themselves before forcing in the door to Taylor’s apartment with a battering ram but Taylor’s family disputes that claim in the lawsuit. Police did not find drugs at the home.Although Walker was initially charged with the attempted murder of a law enforcement officer the charges were dropped. Louisville has since banned the use of no-knock warrants.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/15/breonnataylorlouisvillesettlement/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Sen. Coons turns back left-wing challenge, wins Democratic nomination in Delaware,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/primary-delaware-senate-coons/2020/09/14/8e193d76-f6e9-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
That message hit a wall with Delaware's Democrats and Coons outspent Scarane while securing the endorsement of the elected members of his party as well as a strong endorsement from Biden. Coons also said he wouldn't side with Republicans who blocked a potential Biden agenda if Democrats won control of the Senate in November."If Minority Leader [Mitch] McConnell — doesn't that sound good? — uses the filibuster to block progress ... then I'm not going to stand by and watch" Coons said in an interview this past weekend.Republicans were set to pick a challenger to Coons with the state party endorsing attorney Jim DeMartino over Trump campaign activist Lauren Witzke who has tweeted about her belief in the QAnon conspiracy theory. Entering the day Witzke had raised nearly $170000 to DeMartino's nearly $47000.The Delaware contest marked the end of six months of partisan primaries.Coons who has derided President Trump and also challenged the Democratic Party’s far left aired TV spots and distributed mail that emphasized his support from Biden.It was Coons who received a master’s degree in ethics from Yale Divinity School who spoke of Biden’s faith at the Democratic convention nominating the party’s presidential standard-bearer last month saying “I’ve known Joe about 30 years and I’ve seen his faith in action.”Scarane did not attract the endorsements or fundraising numbers of the year’s major left-wing campaigns like New York congressional candidate Jamaal Bowman who won his Democratic primary race. But her campaign said Monday that it had made more than 900000 voter contact attempts reaching most of Delaware’s Democratic voters. It returned to in-person canvassing last month while Coons’s campaign did not.The senator outspent Scarane on ads.“I have an election and I’m delivering the resources needed to win the election” said Coons. “I don’t think that says I’m on the run. It says that I’m standing for reelection.”The senator did not debate Scarane but the race finished the story of the left’s primary campaigning this year which unseated three House Democrats and won a string of victories down the ballot. Delaware Democrats control every statewide office and a majority in the legislature and Gov. John Carney had only a nominal primary challenge.Republicans who have not won a statewide race in Delaware since 2014 faced serious disadvantages this year. Their best-known candidate for governor state Sen. Colin Bonini ran and lost to Carney by 19 points four years ago; Carney whose response to the coronavirus pandemic has been popular was in a stronger position this time. Bonini had five primary opponents including lawyer Julianne Murray who was endorsed by the state Republican Party.The GOP was also picking its challenger to Coons who was first elected when conservative activist Christine O’Donnell unexpectedly won the party’s primary then flamed out in the general election after having to insist to voters that she didn’t practice witchcraft. Delaware Republicans endorsed DeMartino but he was heavily outspent by Witzke a pro-Trump activist who has tweeted the slogan (“WWG1WGA”) of the QAnon conspiracy movement.QAnon conspiracy theorists believe that Trump is battling a cabal of “deep state” saboteurs who worship Satan and traffic children for sex. The FBI has identified the movement as a potential domestic terrorist threat.Though not endorsed by Trump Witzke tweeted at the president and his son Donald Trump Jr. on Monday claiming that a child had been egged at one of her campaign events. The president’s son retweeted it.The president stayed out of the House primary race too though the state GOP endorsed Lee Murphy an actor and perennial candidate in the contest to face Democratic Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester.Louisiana will hold all-party primaries on Election Day on Nov. 3 and Georgia will hold an all-party primary for the seat held by Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R).,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/primary-delaware-senate-coons/2020/09/14/8e193d76-f6e9-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Jon Stewart urges health-care law for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/09/15/jon-stewart-burn-pits-veterans/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The wars in Afghanistan Iraq and elsewhere generated enormous amounts of waste including vehicle parts lithium-ion batteries solvents amputated limbs. U.S. contractors soaked the items in jet fuel and set them ablaze in hundreds of open-air burn pits some larger than a football field. Veterans advocates say service members exposed to the pits developed cancer and respiratory illnesses but the U.S. government has said the toxic substances are not conclusively linked to severe health conditions.In an address at the U.S. Capitol Stewart blasted lawmakers for not granting broad care and benefits to veterans sickened by burn pits and said the U.S. government has failed service members by setting an “almost impossibly high bar” to prove they were exposed to toxins.“War after war after war we treat them as expendable. And when they come home we’re done with them” Stewart said later Tuesday in an interview with The Washington Post. “If an enemy did this to us we’d … bomb them into oblivion. We did it to ourselves and we’re ignoring it.”As many as 3.5 million service members were exposed to burn pits and toxic chemicals during the first Gulf War through the global war on terrorism said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) who proposed the legislation with Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.). The measure would grant presumption of exposure to veterans with certain conditions and who served in one of 33 countries where troops were deployed after the 9/11 attacks Gillibrand said.That would reduce the burden of evidence they must currently provide she said such as exposure to specific burn pits and authoritative links to illnesses. That high bar has led to many denials of claims and care according to Gillibrand and advocates.VA has maintained there is not enough scientific evidence to conclusively link exposure and chronic health problems and evaluates claims on an individual basis.Danielle Robinson said her husband Heath Robinson developed stage-4 lung cancer after serving with the Ohio National Guard in Iraq where he lived near burn pits. Doctors said his condition was consistent with toxic exposure Robinson told reporters. He died in May.“My husband is dead because America poisoned its soldiers” Robinson said.Gillibrand told The Post she and other advocates have tried for years to broaden the scope of benefits and care for sickened veterans contending with other lawmakers and VA.“We’ve tried everything else” Gillibrand said. But the plight of New York first responders she said provided a helpful road map.“We did the epidemiology studies. We know the toxins created on 9/11 were the same at these burn pits” she said.The fight for presuming illnesses related to exposure is similar to the plight of Vietnam veterans who for decades were denied care for exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange. VA now presumes certain conditions are related to exposure based on deployment history rather than relying on the veteran to prove they encountered the chemical at a certain place.VA spokeswoman Christina Noel said eligibility requirements for VA health care and disability compensation are set by Congress. VA monitors the latest research on burn pits she said including a National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine study issued Friday.None of 27 severe illnesses met sufficient criteria to be linked to toxic exposure the report found and other conditions such as chronic persistent cough shortness of breath and wheezing had limited or suggestive links.Noel said the study found “insufficient evidence” linking respiratory illnesses and combat deployments. The report authors cautioned against such an interpretation saying incomplete data prevented researchers from drawing definitive conclusions.A tiny number of compensation claims filed since 2007 — more than 14000 out of nearly 16 million — are related to burn pits Noel said. She did not say how many of those were denied.VA could serve a more proactive role as a veterans health advocate Stewart said. “But VA is being purposefully obtuse and they’re purposely misdirecting people as a way of avoiding responsibility … they put veterans on almost a literal trial.”VA opened a burn pit registry for veterans to document health concerns and recently noted the 200000th registrant — a fraction of the overall number that may have been exposed.“It is past time that veterans exposed to these deadly toxins receive the benefits that they deserve” said Jeremy Butler the chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America an advocacy group that joined other veterans groups in endorsing the proposed bill.In Iraq one notoriously large pit in Balad burned continuously for years at one point incinerating 147 tons of waste per day Military Times reported.Military officials including an Air Force bioenvironmental engineer in 2006 cautioned that the Balad burn pit posed acute and chronic health risks Military Times reported.Stewart who was also a fierce proponent of extending the health fund for Sept. 11 first responders said the items burned at Balad and elsewhere included the remnants of firearms.“The smoking gun” Stewart said “is literally smoking guns.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/09/15/jon-stewart-burn-pits-veterans/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Opinion | The Supreme Court must step in to stop Florida Republicans from disenfranchising voters,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-supreme-court-must-step-in-to-stop-florida-republicans-from-disenfranchising-voters/2020/09/15/60b8dbe0-f6d3-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Shortly after Floridians voted via a state constitutional amendment to enfranchise felons who had finished their prison sentences the GOP legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) moved to require that to register ex-convicts not only finish serving their prison terms but also pay any fines or fees owed. This subversion of the ballot measure voters had just approved is a modern-day poll tax: Wealthy felons can easily afford to pay any court fees while poorer felons might struggle paying off their debts.Moreover some 85000 released-felon Floridians already had registered to vote. Reversing course after the fact would require election officials to try to go name by name striking those who still owed court fees without an accessible centralized database from which to pull the needed information. The system is so opaque many felons themselves do not know whether they owe anything.In other words injustice and chaos are what the 11th Circuit endorsed Friday when it sided with Mr. DeSantis. The voter-approved amendment commands the state “to automatically restore the right to vote for people with prior felony convictions except those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense upon completion of their sentences including prison parole and probation.” Republicans and the 11th Circuit argue that paying off fines and fees falls under the amendment’s definition of completing one’s sentence even if state bureaucracy or poverty make doing so impossible. Three of the six judges joining in the 11th Circuit’s dubious ruling are on President Trump’s list of possible Supreme Court picks should he win a second term.Understandably the Supreme Court often resists meddling in election procedure disputes as Election Day approaches. But the argument to make an exception in this case is compelling. The partisan intent behind the Republican effort is clear. The campaign to ignore the will of the voters is egregious. The practical consequences of a chaotic last-minute disenfranchisement of possibly tens of thousands in a swing state just weeks before a presidential election in the middle of a pandemic that already makes running an election extremely difficult could be severe. The Supreme Court must step in.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-supreme-court-must-step-in-to-stop-florida-republicans-from-disenfranchising-voters/2020/09/15/60b8dbe0-f6d3-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Lost humpback whale stuck in crocodile-infested river is safe,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/14/humpback-whale-crocodiles-australia-river/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“The whale continues to appear safe and well which is allowing us time to ensure we assess all the options available and the associated risks” park zoologist Feach Moyle said in a statement Tuesday.Moyle said park officials are weighing options including minimal and active intervention “to attempt supporting the animal to move out of the river.” Those involved in rescue planning hope the highest tide of the year which is due in a matter of weeks will provide the whale with a “window of opportunity” to make its way back to sea.Video footage taken from a helicopter above the East Alligator River on Tuesday shows the animal rising to the surface before disappearing once again into Kakadu’s waters — home to an estimated 10000 crocodiles.“The best-case scenario is for the whale to make its way back out to sea” officials said Friday in an Instagram post adding the animal did not appear to be in distress and it was not in “an emergency situation” — despite the presence of predatory crocodiles in the misleadingly named river which doesn’t contain any alligators.Authorities have set up an exclusion zone along the river to protect the whale from clashing with boaters. Officials said they were concerned boats may scare the animal farther upstream and have asked people to avoid the area.Saltwater and freshwater crocodiles are frequently spotted in the park and can be found camouflaging in creeks and sunbathing in coastal areas.Visitors to the park are warned that the dangerous animals “move with great stealth” and are asked to be careful when camping swimming or sailing. People are also reminded the crocodiles can hold their breath underwater for long periods and may lunge and grab unsuspecting visitors from boats.On the park’s official website visitors are urged to report “aggressive crocodiles” to management and are reminded crocodiles can attack in an instant while charging up to almost 40 feet a second.Despite the threat the crocodiles may keep their distance from the lost humpback — at least for now experts said.“It’s not something a crocodile would even be capable of attacking” she said. “It’s just way out of a crocodile’s world.”But if the whale becomes distressed and gets trapped on a bank she said it would be “an easy feed” for the crocodiles.Regina Asmutis-Silvia executive director at Whale and Dolphin Conservation for North America expressed concern for the whale’s health Tuesday saying a photo shared to Instagram of the animal suggests it is “pretty thin” and “underlying conditions” may have led it to become lost in the river.Asmutis-Silvia noted the whale’s spine and shoulder blades appear to be visible features that are not often on display in healthier whales.“This whale is not the picture of health and may have more to worry about than crocs” she said.Another marine scientist Jason Fowler who first spotted the whale Sept. 2 told the ABC “we’re all pretty keen to try to get this guy out.”Whales have never been spotted along the river before sparking a wave of interest and excitement among locals. Fowler told the ABC that Kakadu’s Aboriginal elders “said there’s no name for whales. It’s not recorded in their cultural history. They’ve never heard of this before.”While they may be new to the East Alligator River this isn’t the first time a whale has been spotted somewhere unexpected.In 2018 a lone beluga was seen swimming in Britain’s River Thames; the British public lovingly named the whale Benny.Belugas are usually found in groups in Arctic waters. When “Benny” showed up in the Thames the BBC launched a live stream and businesses began selling “Benny the beluga”-themed Christmas cards and stuffed toys. Pubs even served “Benny Beer.” The Port of London Authority later said it was likely Benny found his way back to the ocean — three months after he was first spotted.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/14/humpback-whale-crocodiles-australia-river/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Frustrated House Democrats push for action on new economic relief bill ,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/09/15/congress-democrats-coronavirus-relief-economy/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced on a conference call with House Democrats on Tuesday morning that the House would remain in session until a new agreement is struck saying “We have to stay here until we have a bill” according to Democratic aides.But within hours Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) clarified that lawmakers would not actually remain in Washington beyond their scheduled recess date of Oct. 2 and instead would be required to be on call in case they must return. This is the same arrangement lawmakers have worked under for more than a month without any progress. White House officials have remained open to a deal but have not expressed an urgency to make concessions.Pelosi has been unwilling to budge from the position she’s held for months -- that Democrats should hold out for a wide-ranging bill with a pricetag of at least $2 trillion covering a multitude of issues from unemployment insurance to testing to the Post Office. Increasing numbers of rank-and-file Democrats are beginning to question that approach.Frustration boiled over on a call the centrist New Democrat Coalition held with Pelosi and Hoyer on Tuesday. The coalition includes a number freshman lawmakers who beat Republicans in 2018 and are now facing tough re-election races in GOP-leaning seats.At one point pressed by Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) about why members shouldn’t physically stay in town to wait for a deal Pelosi suggested Rice should poll fellow lawmakers on the issue.After Pelosi got off the call Hoyer faced more pushback over the situation and expressed sympathy but said repeatedly that he did not want to undermine Pelosi.Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) responded to a comment from a fellow lawmaker who said members should be following their convictions by saying: “My conviction is to actually do my goddamn job and come up with a solution for the American people. We have to bring something to the floor.”Details of the call were first reported by Politico and confirmed by several Democratic aides familiar with them who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss them.The developments occurred on the first full day the House was back in session from its August recess with lawmakers eyeing a three-week sprint that must also include passing a stopgap spending bill to fund the government by Sept. 30.Pelosi has not moved from the position she’s held ever since the House passed the $3.4 trillion Heroes Act in May legislation Republicans and the Trump administration dismissed as they waited months to start talks that ultimately went nowhere.On the morning conference call with the House Democratic caucus Pelosi rejected the notion of a slimmed-down or “skinny” bill such as the $300 billion measure Democrats blocked last week in the Senate.“A skinny bill is not a deal. It’s a Republican bill” Pelosi said on the conference call.With Republicans unwilling to agree to legislation anywhere near the scope Pelosi wants some Democrats have begun to discuss other options. There are roughly 29 million Americans receiving some form of jobless aid and many households are struggling to pay their rent and other bills. State and city budgets are also under severe strain and many have cut large parts of their workforce as they wait for Congress to decide whether to approve more assistance.The stock market has mostly recovered its losses from March however and President Trump has suggested he thinks a robust recovery is underway. But Democrats around the country including many freshmen who flipped GOP seats in 2018 and helped the party retake the House majority represent districts where individuals small businesses local governments and schools remain in dire need of help.Some House Democrats in tough reelection races are under growing pressure to take action to help their constituents. In one race in Virginia where Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria is defending her seat against the Republican she beat in 2018 an outside group has run ads attacking her for inaction on coronavirus relief.Luria said in an interview Tuesday that she was pleased to hear Pelosi pledge action.“The truth is that the bottom-line number isn’t as important as the fact that we need to as a country respond to people who are in need during an unprecedented public health crisis” Luria said.Another Democrat in a contested race Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) told reporters Tuesday that action on coronavirus relief was crucial for him and his colleagues — even if it’s just to demonstrate to voters that Republicans are the ones who are unwilling to compromise.“I think that if people are able to see us stay here and offer a proposal that is easy to understand simple and tailored to the pandemic regardless of what size it is and it’s rejected by them then we will have done an important thing which is show people that we’re reasonable” Lamb said.Pelosi and her top lieutenants have shown scant interest in considering a bill with a price tag under $2 trillion however.The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus in the House released its own attempted compromise Tuesday morning a $1.5 trillion proposal that could grow larger or smaller depending on infection rates and vaccine progress. Trump administration officials have encouraged the group’s efforts but top Democrats rejected it out of hand with eight House committee chairs issuing a joint statement saying it “falls short of what is needed to save lives and boost the economy.”Congress passed four bills totaling about $3 trillion in aid in March and April but has not acted since. Many of the programs agreed to in the initial round of spending have expired including a $600 weekly enhanced unemployment benefit that ran out July 31. Trump stepped in last month with some limited executive actions including replacing the $600 benefit with one half that size but the money for that is now running dry.White House adviser Jared Kushner suggested in an interview Tuesday on CNBC that a deal might have to wait.“The hope is that we’ll still get to a deal. It may have to be after the election” Kushner said.At the same time if it becomes clear in coming days that no comprehensive deal is in reach Pelosi may start holding votes on individual issues such as funding for coronavirus testing to show that House Democrats are trying to address the problem.Paul Kane contributed to this report.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/09/15/congress-democrats-coronavirus-relief-economy/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Grand jury issues subpoenas in Bolton book investigation related to handling of classified information,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/grand-jury-issues-subpoenas-in-bolton-book-investigation-related-to-handling-of-classified-information/2020/09/15/b0f27dd6-f76f-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The book recounts Bolton’s 17 months as President Trump’s top national security official and paints a withering portrait of Trump as an “erratic” and “stunningly uninformed” leader. The Trump administration unsuccessfully sought to block the book’s release in June saying it contained classified information that wasn’t properly reviewed before publication.Bolton a veteran diplomat and security expert has denied the book contains classified information cited his cooperation with a lengthy pre-publication review and added that he brought decades of experience working with secret material to the task.In a statement Bolton’s lawyer Charles J. Cooper said his team was aware of reports that subpoenas had been issued.“Ambassador Bolton emphatically rejects any claim that he acted improperly let alone criminally in connection with the publication of his book and he will cooperate fully as he has throughout with any official inquiry into his conduct” Cooper said.A spokesman for Simon & Schuster declined to comment.The grand jury case was opened after a federal judge rejected the Justice Department’s emergency request to block the book’s June 23 publication said the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the matter. The New York Times first reported on the grand jury subpoenas.The Justice Department had requested a restraining order on the book arguing Bolton breached a contract with the government by not completing a required national security review for classified information.In a June 20 ruling U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the District of Columbia denied the Trump administration’s request citing the publisher’s declaration that more than 200000 copies had already shipped.However in an opinion in the government lawsuit seeking financial damages the judge said Bolton “exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability” in further litigation.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.Another person familiar with the case said department officials pursued the case as soon as details of the book began appearing in public but the effort gained added momentum with Lamberth’s written ruling.Opening a grand jury case and issuing subpoenas is one of many early steps in an investigation and leak investigations in particular can be lengthy. Most submissions to the Justice Department for leak cases are not forwarded to prosecutors for investigation and most of such investigations do not result in charges said one person familiar with the matter.In Bolton’s case assessing his intentions the government’s handling of the classification review and the dispute’s political aspects adds further complexity.In pre-publication litigation the government disclosed that national security adviser Robert C. O’Brien whom Trump appointed to succeed Bolton ordered an additional review of Bolton’s book after a career National Security Council staffer said he had completed required edits.Gen. Paul M. Nakasone director of the National Security Agency also declared in a court affidavit that a limited portion of the draft manuscript “implicates” information classified at the highest level. He said the “compromise of this information could result in the permanent loss of a valuable [signal intelligence] source and cause irreparable damage to the U.S. [signal intelligence] system.” Such intelligence is derived from electronic systems used by foreign targets such as communications systems radars and weapons systems.Bolton has alleged that a career White House official Ellen Knight effectively cleared his manuscript in April before Trump political appointees tried to stall it through the presidential election in November. Cooper argued that Trump appointees politicized the clearance process in a manner that if allowed to stand would keep future officials from speaking out when they leave government.Trump has responded on Twitter saying he hoped Bolton would be investigated. Trump said Bolton “broke the law” and should be in jail and have money seized “for disseminating for profit highly Classified information.” He also has called Bolton a “Wacko” and his memoir “a compilation of lies and made up stories all intended to make me look bad.”In a June court hearing Deputy Assistant Attorney General David M. Morrell acknowledged to the judge that he knew of no precedent in which high-level officials intervened in classification reviews.O’Brien tapped another new appointee Michael Ellis — a former aide to Rep.

Faced with Russia crises, Trump and top aides strike different tones,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-russia-navalny-belarus/2020/09/15/425452ca-f759-11ea-a510-f57d8ce76e11_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The situation shows how faced with two of the biggest political events to shake Russia in years the Trump administration has fallen back on a familiar pattern: U.S. diplomats are mounting a hawkish response even as Trump articulates a more Moscow-friendly message. The result is a paucity of presidential leadership — and mixed messages to allies and adversaries.“This is the story of the Trump administration” said Angela Stent a Russia scholar at Georgetown University. “We have this bifurcated Russia policy where the president clearly has his agenda to improve relations with Moscow but he hasn’t been able to implement it because it’s such a politically sensitive subject. And then you have the State Department and Defense Department with a much tougher and more consistent policy.”Stent said the same response had been on display in recent weeks as the administration reacted to the uprising in Belarus and Navalny’s poisoning. “The president won’t say whether Navalny has been poisoned and on Belarus he won’t say anything that’s critical of Putin” Stent said. “He’s ready to criticize Germany or [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel who wants to import Russian gas but not Putin.”The administration has made the No. 2 official at the State Department Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun the point person on Russia. In recent weeks he has met with officials in Moscow and Europe as well as members of the Belarusian opposition in a round of crisis diplomacy.A former Ford Motor lobbyist and veteran Republican aide on Capitol Hill Biegun has won praise from Democrats and Republicans for staking out a hawkish position toward the Kremlin in the role.On a Sept. 11 call with reporters Biegun criticized the Russian government for its failure to launch a thorough investigation into what he said was the use of a banned nerve agent on its own territory against a Russian citizen.“It is unbelievable to us that this would happen on the territory of any country and the government would not react with the appropriate urgency to investigate and hold accountable those who committed the crime” Biegun said.The Russian government has rejected allegations of Kremlin involvement in the poisoning.In Belarus thousands of demonstrators took to the streets for the sixth week in a row last weekend to protest an Aug. 9 presidential election they believed was rigged by President Alexander Lukashenko the former Soviet collective farm boss who has ruled the nation for 26 years. The protesters argue that Svetlana Tikhanovskaya the wife of a jailed opposition figure prevailed in the flawed election and should become the nation’s next president.In Europe Biegun met with Tikhanovskaya who fled to neighboring Lithuania in the wake of the election amid pressure from Belarusian authorities. Biegun has committed to new sanctions on Belarusian officials in response to the human rights abuses against demonstrators but has said the leader of the nation is for the Belarusian people to decide.“The Belarusian people are entitled to a free and fair election in which they choose their own leaders and they were denied that opportunity on August 9th. There is no legitimacy delivered to the ruler of Belarus by the August 9th election” Biegun said in the call last week. He has urged authorities in Belarus to negotiate with the opposition and hold a new election under independent observation.Behind the scenes Biegun and other senior State Department officials have pushed European allies to uniformly condemn the attack on Navalny and Lukashenko’s actions.Earlier this month NATO’s principal decision-making body condemned Navalny’s poisoning in the “strongest possible terms” given the use of a “nerve agent from the banned Novichok group.”Some nations in the 30-member alliance opposed issuing a statement and some sought softer language including France but the United States pushed members to approve the tougher wording according to diplomats familiar with the internal deliberations.U.S. officials have also held a tough line with Moscow at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe a multilateral organization in which Russia is a member diplomats said.“Biegun is a godsend” said a European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic conversations. “While you’d normally hope to see a firm public stance from a U.S. president no one’s under any illusion that Trump would be that messenger so we’re content with Biegun.”But Biegun’s diplomacy has been overshadowed by the mixed messages and relative silence from Trump.Trump has said little about the protests in Belarus noting that he “likes seeing democracy” and that “it doesn’t seem like it’s too much democracy there” and separately describing the situation as “terrible.”Two days after Merkel presented what she called “unequivocal proof” that Navalny was poisoned with a chemical similar to the Soviet-era nerve agent Novachok possibly implicating the Russian government Trump said he didn’t know what happened to the Russian opposition figure.“I don’t know exactly what happened” Trump said on Sept. 4. “I think it’s — it’s tragic. It’s terrible. It shouldn’t happen. We haven’t had any proof yet but I will take a look.”Some 26 days since the poisoning the United States has yet to issue any formal government assessment and Trump hasn’t brought up the matter with Putin according to the records of his calls that are publicly available. On Tuesday Navalny posted a photo of himself in a German hospital and said he was able to breathe on his own after weeks on a ventilator.“Biegun made the stops I would have made. He saw the people I would have seen. He hit all the marks” said Daniel Fried a former top U.S. diplomat who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council. “The question is if you are listening to him and you are a European diplomat. … Does this guy speak for the administration or does he speak for that part of the administration that is other than Donald Trump?”Critics say Trump has offered confusing statements about U.S. priorities following Navalny’s poisoning pointing to his reluctance to condemn the incident as a chemical weapon poisoning possibly involving the Russian state. Trump told reporters on Sept. 4 at the White House that “we’re right now negotiating a nuclear nonproliferation treaty which is very important.”“It’s a very important thing” Trump said of the talks. “To me it’s the most important thing.”He asked reporters why they weren’t questioning him more about China instead.Biegun later clarified that the United States can pursue nuclear negotiations with Russia aimed at extending and expanding the New START accord and manage issues related to Belarus and Navalny at the same time.“Nobody in the United States is linking our positions on either the theft of the elections and the brutal violence in Belarus nor the tragic poisoning of Alexei Navalny to any other — any other matters New START or negotiations or anything else” he said last week.When asked about Navalny’s poisoning Trump was quick to point out that he had good relations with Putin even though his administration had taken tough measures against Russia.Trump briefly used the question about Navalny to criticize Germany for proceeding with Nord Stream 2 a pipeline set to carry Russian gas to Europe that the Trump administration has opposed.Andrew S. Weiss vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former top Russia official in the Clinton administration said an administration has a Russia policy only insofar as the president supports it.“There’s no Russia policy beyond that which [Trump] is willing to put his name on” Weiss said. “In theory the U.S. should be shaping the West’s policy toward Russia.

Australia’s coronavirus ‘dictator’ enforces a drastic lockdown. He’s still popular.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/australia-coronavirus-melbourne-lockdown-daniel-andrews/2020/09/15/8440d9bc-f243-11ea-8025-5d3489768ac8_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The city named repeatedly over recent years as the “ world’s most livable ” has been locked down since July 9. A week ago Andrews declared that a citywide curfew will not be lifted until Oct. 26 — and then only if the coronavirus is almost eliminated. In Melbourne public life has essentially come to a halt. Schools are shuttered. Roads are empty. The only shops open are gas stations supermarkets and drugstores.People who don’t work in an essential industry are allowed to leave their houses only for two hours’ exercise a day or to buy food care for others or seek medical attention. Soldiers go door-to-door checking that infected people are in isolation. Police ask cyclists for identification to ensure they are not breaching a rule allowing exercise only within five kilometers (3.1 miles) of their homes.Federal officials managing their first recession in 29 years have pleaded with Andrews to loosen rules that are dragging down Australia’s economy. The number of people in Melbourne receiving government unemployment benefits has risen 7.2 percent to about 410000 since June 26 and spending by individuals in Victoria is down 30 percent according to the federal Treasury Department.Derided by his critics as one of Australia’s least-charismatic political leaders with no professional experience outside the center-left Labor Party or state government Andrews argues that the pandemic needs to be aggressively suppressed now to avoid future lockdowns caused by new virus waves that could inflict worse damage.“We have to get the numbers low and keep them low” he said Monday. “That’s exactly what we will achieve by everyone working together.”By stoically explaining his position and reasoning every day in news conferences that have become a surprise television ratings hit Andrews seems to have convinced Melburnians that the tough measures are necessary.An opinion poll last week by Roy Morgan Research reported that 62 percent of voters in the city did not want the curfew ended right away and that more than two-thirds of voters across the state approve of Andrews’s performance.But health experts — even those who want the novel coronavirus eliminated from Australia something no large country has achieved — worry that Andrews may have gone too far to control a disease that has killed a similar number of people in Melbourne as the District of Columbia which has one-eighth of the Australian city’s population and a death toll of 616.“I do find that strange as an epidemiologist that we have to go such extremes when the case numbers are manageable” said Catherine Bennett an infectious-diseases expert at Deakin University in an interview.On Tuesday Andrews’s health department recorded 42 new coronavirus cases and no deaths. On Thursday most restrictions will be lifted outside Melbourne following a drop in cases.Throughout the lockdown Andrews’s government has responded to isolated acts of defiance with displays of force. Public demonstrations and encouraging others to participate in them have been declared illegal. Some workers have arranged clandestine meetings with colleagues in supermarkets.On Sept. 2 state police officers arrested and handcuffed a pregnant woman wearing pink pajamas in front of her child and husband for trying to organize an anti-lockdown protest through Facebook in the regional city of Ballarat.Then on Sunday activists including some virus conspiracy theorists used an encrypted messaging app to arrange a protest in Melbourne’s central food market where they could conceivably pretend to be shopping.When news of the protest was posted on social media an hour in advance police swamped the area with officers on horseback and others wielding batons and thick plastic shields.As protesters yelled “Freedom!” the police arrested 74 people and issued the equivalent of $200000 in fines. “Protesting is stupid protesting is selfish and protesting is dangerous” Andrews said afterward.“Are we in the hands of a madman?” responded Chris Lucas one of the city’s prominent restaurateurs in an interview.That evening the rules were relaxed a little in response to an earlier decision. The curfew now begins an hour later at 9 p.m. People who live alone are allowed to designate another individual for brief social visits.But until Oct. 26 most children will not be allowed to return to school nor will adults be able to move freely. To meet that target there will have to be fewer than five cases on average every day for two weeks and fewer than five cases a day that cannot be traced to an existing outbreak over two weeks under the Victorian government’s strategy to defeat the virus.Nick Baker a 43-year-old Melbourne resident and aviation-industry worker said he supports the lockdown but is struggling with the lack of physical contact with friends or family apart from his wife Janis.The couple planned a vacation to Las Vegas last month for her 40th birthday. Australia has banned most foreign travel and the Bakers’ backup plan a trip along Victoria’s scenic Great Ocean Road is now illegal.Instead Baker bought his wife a cake baked to look like the famous “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign at the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip.“This morning it hit me that the day Stage 4 [restrictions] were meant to end is actually the beginning of another six weeks until we can have friends visit or get out of our 5-kilometer radius” he said in an email Sunday.“The road map out doesn’t give a lot of hope. I think it’s necessary but that doesn’t make it any easier. We just want to go for a drive to the beach.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/australia-coronavirus-melbourne-lockdown-daniel-andrews/2020/09/15/8440d9bc-f243-11ea-8025-5d3489768ac8_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Fear in Northern Ireland, as Boris Johnson threatens the E.U. over Brexit,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/brexit-northern-ireland/2020/09/15/05a90dcc-f6a8-11ea-85f7-5941188a98cd_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Britain will leave the European Union at the end of 2020 with or without a new free-trade deal Johnson promises. With just over three months to go before the end of a transition period a pact between the sides seems as far away as ever. Relations between Europe and Britain have grown shouty underlining the high stakes of the showdown as Britain and Europe both struggle to recover from deep pandemic recessions.Rachel Powell grew up in South Armagh where during the Troubles a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was patrolled by British troops often attacked by Irish republican militants. She said she’s deeply concerned about what will happen next.“The British government has not got a clue about what it is like to live on the border and it is again using it as a political football” said Powell a lobbyist with the Women’s Resource and Development Agency in Belfast.The 1998 Good Friday Agreement brought peace to Ireland — and today the line marking the boundary between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is invisible.Powell said border communities are “horrified” over the uncertainties and brinkmanship of Brexit.In the past week Johnson started to deploy martial language asserting that the E.U. is plotting to “carve up our country” and to choke off food supplies with destabilizing new barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.“Unless we agree to the E.U.’s terms the E.U. will use an extreme interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol to impose a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea” Johnson wrote in the Telegraph newspaper.Irish Foreign Affairs Secretary Simon Coveney dismissed Johnson’s claim that Europe wanted to “blockade” Northern Ireland as “totally bogus.”Europeans are livid that Johnson has introduced a bill before Parliament that would breach key parts of the Brexit withdrawal treaty an agreement Johnson signed only nine months ago calling the pact “historic” and “fantastic.”The deal seeks to finesse trade and customs issues to enable Northern Ireland to exit along with the rest of the United Kingdom but to preserve easy trade — and psychological ties — with the Republic of Ireland which will remain part of the E.U. In the absence of a free-trade deal there would probably have to be some kind of controls between north and south to levy tariffs and quotas.Chief E.U. negotiator Michel Barnier said the Northern Ireland protocol signed last year represents no threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom. He tweeted “We agreed this delicate compromise with [Boris Johnson] & his gov in order to protect peace & stability on island of Ireland. We could not have been clearer about the consequences of #Brexit.”Martin O’Brien is a veteran peace-building activist from north Belfast who worked to ensure that strong human rights were included in the Good Friday Agreement. “Brexit — and this government’s particular form of Brexit a hard Brexit — was embarked on with no regard to the consequences for Northern Ireland” he said.O’Brien called the withdrawal agreement signed by the U.K. and E.U. last year “a carefully constructed mechanism to try to minimize the worst consequences” of Brexit.“Now the government has decided to go back on the compromise and again that is hugely destabilizing” he said.Queen’s University Belfast professor Katy Hayward said “We should be familiar with this by now the stirring up of a political storm over Northern Ireland and its place after Brexit but we are no less weary of it.”She said that “the anxieties are only growing. . . . We face the prospect of the U.K. flagrantly breaking international law and using Northern Ireland’s position as justification for it. This sets a whole new precedent. And it bodes very badly for peace.”During the Troubles more than 3500 people were killed over half of them civilians.Brandon Lewis Johnson’s minister for Northern Ireland admitted to the House of Commons last week that the new bill to amend the Brexit deal with Europe will “break international law” but he said only in a “specific and limited way.”Johnson’s move has set off alarms in the U.S. Congress with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) warning that today’s open border between north and south must be preserved at all costs. Undermine the Good Friday pact Pelosi said and “there will be absolutely no chance of a U.S.-U.K. trade agreement passing the Congress.”If Britain and Europe are unable to sign a trade deal by year’s end then World Trade Organization rules would apply to goods traded between the E.U. and the U.K. with tariffs and quotas levied in both directions. Supply chains 40 years in the making could be derailed.On the island of Ireland there is growing anxiety that Johnson is hurtling toward a no-deal Brexit.“Securing a ‘zero tariff zero quota’ free-trade agreement with the E.U. remains critical to the future of U.K. businesses” said Ann McGregor chief executive of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “We urge ministers to redouble their efforts to reach a comprehensive agreement with our largest trading partner at a crucial time in the negotiations.”Former British prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major joined forces to condemn Johnson’s attempt to override the ­Brexit agreement calling it “shameful.” They urged lawmakers in the Labour and Conservative parties to vote down the bill.“It raises questions that go far beyond the impact on Ireland the peace process and negotiations for a trade deal — crucial though they are. It questions the very integrity of our nation” the pair wrote in the Sunday Times.Since then the bill cleared an initial vote in the House of Commons.Sammy Wilson a senior figure in the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland said his group will table amendments to Johnson’s bill. But he dismissed as “utter bunkum” the former prime ministers’ worry that the Irish peace could unravel.Wilson said Johnson’s bill will make it easier for Northern Ireland to do business with Great Britain with less paperwork.Booth reported from London.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/brexit-northern-ireland/2020/09/15/05a90dcc-f6a8-11ea-85f7-5941188a98cd_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Opinion | Trump seems to believe in magic over science,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-need-a-president-who-sees-science-as-a-solution-not-the-enemy/2020/09/15/a13e3378-f745-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“Well I don’t think science knows actually” Trump replied.Sound familiar? This is the same president who has insisted — repeatedly — that the novel coronavirus would simply “go away.”“It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear” he said in February when U.S. coronavirus cases still numbered in the dozens.As we now know from what he told Bob Woodward at the time the president knew that the virus was far more dangerous than he was telling the country.Had Trump been more honest about the threat he might have generated great support for social distancing or put in place a widespread testing regimen as other countries did potentially blunting the impact of covid-19.Instead the president continues to thumb his nose at safety measures. On Sunday night he held an indoor rally in Henderson Nev. Thousands of his supporters packed a warehouse disregarding a state order limiting indoor gatherings to 50 people.“We are already making the turn. We’re making that round beautiful last turn” to a post-pandemic future Trump told the generally mask-free crowd.None of this comports with reality. The country is approaching a grim milestone of 200000 covid-19 deaths.Yet Trump expects Americans to suspend any doubts that a safe and effective vaccine could be available by “a very special date. You know what date I’m talking about.”That date of course is Nov. 3 which happens to be Election Day. Scientific advancement is worth pursuing Trump apparently believes if it aligns with his political advancement.Even if a vaccine is rolled out by year’s end Anthony S. Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases cautions that life will not return to anything that resembles pre-pandemic normal until the middle or end of 2021.Meanwhile as Fauci tries to temper expectations for the days and months ahead the administration gave a conspiracy theorist and Trump sycophant a leading role in shaping the Department of Health and Human Services’ messaging.Michael Caputo was appointed assistant secretary of public affairs in April despite having no background in health care. He came under fire in recent days for his efforts to manipulate and quash the weekly reports by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which painted a less rosy picture than Trump does about the pandemic.On Sunday Caputo went on an unhinged rant on Facebook Live first reported by the New York Times in which he claimed that CDC scientists who put out data undercutting the president’s version of reality are engaging in “sedition.”“There are scientists who work for this government who do not want America to get well not until after Joe Biden is president” Caputo claimed. His 26-minute tirade included urging Trump supporters to prepare for armed conflict with left-wing “hit squads” after the election: “If you carry guns buy ammunition ladies and gentlemen because it’s going to be hard to get.”Caputo apologized on Tuesday and said he is considering a leave of absence. But the question remains: Why was a political operative put in such a critical job during a mounting national health emergency?Meanwhile Scientific American the country’s oldest continuously published monthly magazine has broken 175 years of tradition and for the first time endorsed a candidate for president.“The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the U.S. and its people — because he rejects evidence and science. The most devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic which cost more than 190000 Americans their lives by the middle of September” editors wrote. “He has also attacked environmental protections medical care and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges.”They added: “That is why we urge you to vote for Joe Biden who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health our economy and the environment.”Imagine how refreshing it would be to have a president who sees science as a solution not the enemy.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-need-a-president-who-sees-science-as-a-solution-not-the-enemy/2020/09/15/a13e3378-f745-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Miami airport officials seize $490,000 stuffed into an accent chair passing through customs,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/09/11/cbp-miami-airport-seized-cash/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers uncovered about $490000 in cash while screening a piece of furniture passing through Miami International Airport last week CBP said in a news release Wednesday. A crate bound for the Dominican Republic on Sept. 3 contained an accent chair that was found to be stuffed with the illegal amount of money. Miami International Airport’s acting port director Robert Del Toro shared an image of the crate and chair full of cash on social media noting that the money was sewn into the cushion of the chair. Amounts of cash that total more than $10000 must be reported at ports of entry or when leaving the country according to the CBP website. [The 10 strangest confiscations TSA has posted on Instagram ranked] “Criminal organizations will attempt to export large sums of cash to launder their ill-gotten gains” Del Toro said in the news release. “This is a significant seizure and represents the impact we can make on criminal’s profits and was the direct result of our officer’s vigilance and watchfulness.” Furniture isn’t the only household item smugglers have used recently: Earlier this month officers at Miami International Airport uncovered a stash of drugs inside a washing machine Del Toro tweeted. “CBP uses a variety of techniques to intercept narcotics unreported currency weapons counterfeit consumer goods prohibited agriculture and other illicit products and to assure that global tourism remains safe and strong” CBP said in the news release. Violating the currency-reporting law results in “seizure and forfeiture of most or all of the currency and potential criminal charges." The agency seizes an average of $207000 per day in illegal currency from its combined operations on U.S. borders according to the news release. The Transportation Security Administration which like CBP is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recently shared that it collected almost a million unclaimed dollars from airport security last year.

The recession is testing the limits and shortfalls of the Federal Reserve’s toolkit,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2020/09/15/fed-emergency-program-recession/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Yet the Fed’s moves have also pushed the central bank into uncharted territory testing how far its tools can go and how inclusive they can be. The central bank was quick to bring interest rates to zero backstop credit markets and buy up corporate debt — but those policies often sidestep Americans who don’t hold investments. A lending program for small and mid-sized businesses has seen little uptake raising doubts about the Fed’s ability to directly help companies fighting for survival. And as the pandemic widens longstanding racial and economic gaps the Fed is facing urgent questions over how it can steer a recovery that lifts all Americans.“The Fed has been very effective at keeping credit flowing in the U.S. economy and that is the result of their creative and vigorous use of these various facilities for encouraging borrowing" said Douglas Elmendorf dean of faculty at the Harvard Kennedy School and former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “What the Fed cannot do on its own with interest rates so low to start with is to stir enough demand for goods and services to put everyone back to work. And what the Fed can’t do is to plug all the gaps in peoples’ incomes."Fed leaders including Chair Jerome H. Powell have said a stable turnaround must be in place before the central bank unwinds its interventions which began in the early days of the pandemic and resulting recession. But much about a recovery is still unknown. Powell is expected to give an update on the economy and the Fed’s thinking on Wednesday at the end of the regular policy meeting of Fed policymakers.As the coronavirus spread in and beyond China and the stock market burrowed further into the red in February the Fed announced an emergency interest rate cut of half a percentage point on March 3 the largest cut at that point since the Great Recession. Twelve days later the Fed announced it would slash rates to zero and buy at least $700 billion in government and mortgage-related bonds to stabilize the financial system and contend with the mounting crisis.As Congress hustled to pass the Cares Act at the end of March the Fed outlined a sprawling set of programs to flood the markets and boost bond purchases. The Fed would also announce a $500 billion program to lend to states and municipalities along with the $600 billion Main Street lending program for small and mid-sized companies.“One of the main things we’re trying to do by assuring the flow of credit in the economy and keeping rates low is to assure that that rebound when it does come is as vigorous as possible” Powell said on NBC’s Today Show on March 26.These moves signaled that the Fed was going far to cushion the financial system. But the response was also meant to build a short-term bridge to when the pandemic was contained and the economy got back on its feet. The $2 trillion Cares Act — which sent stimulus money straight to households businesses and state and local governments — was also crafted to stop the bleeding for a few months.Strong job gains from May and June buoyed hopes that people were going back to work as states reopened and that a spike retail sales pointed to an economic turnaround. Yet unlike in past recessions consumer spending is inextricably linked to a public health crisis. Powell and other Fed leaders have long said that a stable recovery depends on giving people the confidence to safely go about their old routines be it eating at a restaurant getting a hair cut or booking a hotel.By July worsening outbreaks and dips in consumer spending suggested the nascent rebound was slowing."On balance it looks like the data are pointing to a slowing in the pace of the recovery” Powell said at a July 29 press conference. “I want to stress it’s too early to say both how large that is and how sustained it will be.”Throughout the summer Powell and other Fed officials continued their calls for more aid from Congress which can send direct relief to households businesses and local governments. Fed leaders routinely stopped short of outlining what exactly should go into another rescue package. But they made clear that withdrawing direct help too soon would hurt those who were suffering the most.“Fiscal policy is essential here and I would say again Congress’s action early in the pandemic historically large by any standard around the world and certainly by U.S. standards it’s really helping now" Powell said at the July 29 press conference. “As I’ve said very likely more will be needed from all of us and I see Congress negotiating now over a new package and I think that’s a good thing."By the late July and August nearly 30 million Americans lost their $600 enhanced unemployment benefits. Scores of businesses risked shutting down permanently or converting springtime furloughs to layoffs. The recession continued to hurt the working class while the wealthy largely recovered and the stock market climbed towards record highs.That stark gap poses a fundamental challenge for the Fed namely how it can fill the economy’s holes beyond setting interest rates or working through Wall Street. For example the Fed has bought $12.6 billion in bonds through its corporate credit programs and is buying up debt from massive companies that haven’t borne the brunt of the recession.The Main Street lending program has become especially fraught. The program is geared to businesses that might be too small to get relief through the Fed’s corporate credit facilities and may not be able to seek credit elsewhere. Through the Main Street program the Fed buys 95 percent of a loan from a bank leaving lenders with some skin in the game.Of the program’s $600 billion pot the Fed had only completed around $1.4 billion in Main Street loans as of Sept. 9. Many interested businesses say they have trouble finding banks willing to issue loans and many banks particularly larger national firms shy away from the program altogether. Unlike Congress the Fed can only offer loans to companies many of which can’t afford to go into debt.Moreover there’s little consensus from lawmakers over whether to relax and expand the program’s guidelines and allow for riskier loans even as businesses teetering on the edge say they don’t have time to waste.“The Fed says ‘we can only make loans we can’t do grants’” said Kathryn Judge an expert on financial regulation at Columbia Law School. “On the other hand they could do a lot in terms of the structure or the types of risk they’re willing to take and absorb...that could reach a broader set of companies if the Fed and Treasury are willing to do it.”Another $500 billion program to lend money to local governments has only issued two loans — to the state of Illinois and New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority — for a total of $1.6 billion. Fed leaders say it is a good sign that the municipal lending facility has seen little uptake as the municipal bond market perked up once the Fed announced the program. But with state and local governments staring down massive budget shortfalls it’s unclear just how effective the Fed’s program will be.Increasingly the looming question for the Fed is whether or how it can widen the scope of its tools especially when it comes to shaping an economy that works for everyone. Job losses spurred by the pandemic disproportionately hurt low-income workers of color and women who are also less likely to enjoy the benefits of higher stock prices and low mortgage rates. The recession has also sharpened attention on the Fed’s role in responding to systemic racism and the deep-seated inequalities that drag down the broader economy."Part of what is needed and what we’re wrestling with is rethinking exactly what our mandate means” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told The Post earlier this summer. “The important thing about our mandate is that to me it says we should be making sure the economy works for everyone because that’s the way you get to the largest maximum employment. That’s the way you get to the strongest most resilient economy.”That thinking extends well beyond the current crisis and informs the Fed’s approach to stable prices and maximum employment. A new long-term vision was spelled out in part last month when Powell unveiled a policy framework signaling that the Fed won’t respond to low unemployment levels by raising rates and slowing the economy. The framework also allows for inflation to temporarily rise above the Fed’s 2 percent target to balance out periods when inflation dipped below though there are plenty of unknowns about how that framework will come into practice.Now six months into the crisis it isn’t entirely clear what comes next. At this week’s meeting the Fed isn’t expected to change rates. Powell has said that the Fed isn’t “even thinking about thinking about raising rates" and the emergency programs are staying in place.But the economy remains in trouble. Just over half of the 22 million total jobs lost between February and April have not returned. Hopes are fading for another rescue package from Capitol Hill.“The rest of us have to come to the realization that fiscal response is absolutely necessary” said William Spriggs chief economist to the AFL-CIO and an economics professor at Howard University. “You cannot borrow your way to rich. And that’s the Fed’s function. The Fed’s function is to make sure that borrowing and liquidity are there and that healthy firms have a way to smooth their income so that they can make it. We are no longer in that ‘smoothing income’ phase.”The coronavirus has claimed at least 191000 lives in the U.S. and health officials warn that outbreaks colliding with flu season in the fall and winter could be even more overwhelming. With each passing week fear is growing that the longterm wounds of this recession will turn to scars.“The longer-term challenge here is that the decisions we’re making in this period of time are going to shape the structure of the economy that emerges from it" said Judge of Columbia Law School.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2020/09/15/fed-emergency-program-recession/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Chicago radio host fired for ‘degrading’ tweet that mocked ESPN’s Maria Taylor,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/radio-host-fired-espn-maria-taylor/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“AVN” refers to Adult Video News which presents an annual awards show that has been described as “the Oscars of porn.” Adult-film actresses have frequently served as hosts for those shows.McNeil quickly deleted his tweet but not before it received backlash from other Twitter users including several current and former ESPN colleagues of Taylor.“Just another example of what women have to go through in this business” tweeted former “SportsCenter” host Jemele Hill. “Huge accomplishment for Maria to be part of the MNF team tonight and here comes an [expletive] trying to undermine a big moment in her career.”Taylor herself eventually weighed in while sharing a report on McNeil’s tweet. “Well Danny Dearest if you would like to continue making sexist comments about me … please bring your misogyny with you to the NBA Countdown double header I’ll be hosting tomorrow night” Taylor tweeted Monday evening after she served as sideline reporter for a game between the New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers. “Hey ladies remember you can wear whatever you feel confident in!”McNeil was fired Tuesday by Entercom Chicago the company that owns WSCR-AM where McNeil had been hosting a show since 2018 in his third stint at the station.“For each one of us our words have power. For our brands and on-air personalities that is amplified and brings increased responsibility in how we chose to use our voices. Last night’s tweet and its degrading and humiliating tone to a fellow female broadcaster was unacceptable” Entercom Chicago executive Rachel Williamson wrote in an email to staff (via the Chicago Sun-Times).“We have the best teams in Chicago and we must hold ourselves to high expectations to continue to be leaders in our organization our industry and our community. We apologize to all who were offended by Dan’s words especially Maria.”McNeil 59 has yet to publicly comment on his firing.ESPN said in a statement provided to The Washington Post “Too often women are subjected to this type of commentary. Women in sports deserve respect for their abilities and intellect not judgment regarding their appearance. Maria Taylor has our full and unequivocal support.”At the end of Tuesday’s ESPN’s “NBA Countdown” analysts Jalen Rose and Jay Williams gave her flowers and hugs as Rose thanked her for “your intellect your beauty and your class in all situations.” “Maria you are so incredible at what you do” Williams told her as Taylor grew emotional “and I love the way you clap back at people that come to you with ignorance. So thank you for continuing to be that example that we need.”Taylor 33 a former basketball and volleyball player at the University of Georgia who returned to the school to complete an MBA in 2013 began appearing on ESPN the following year as a college sports reporter and analyst. Since then she has been featured on programs including “NBA Countdown” “College GameDay” “ABC Saturday Night Football” and “Get Up” and she is in her first season with “MNF.”Among other ESPN colleagues to express support for Taylor was Hannah Storm who saluted Entercom for firing McNeil and wrote “Stay strong and keep shining as the smart professional special talent that you are!!!”In 2010 ESPN suspended commentator Tony Kornheiser after he critiqued on his radio show an outfit Storm was wearing on TV. “She’s got on red go-go boots and a Catholic school plaid skirt … way too short for somebody in her 40s or maybe early 50s by now” Kornheiser said at the time. “She looks like she has sausage casing wrapping around her upper body.”Others who came to Taylor’s defense Tuesday included Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant who told her on Twitter “We with you.”“And here we go with this [expletive]" Michael Eaves a “SportsCenter” anchor tweeted. “The depth of some men’s insecurities will never cease to amaze me. Does my girl @MariaTaylor trigger y’all that badly for real?!?”“Women in our business face a level of scrutiny and ridicule most will never understand” ESPN’s Jenna Laine said on Twitter. “We are constantly attacked for our appearance hair clothing and voices. It’s PAINFUL. For Black women in media it goes even farther. And it HAS to stop. Standing with you @MariaTaylor.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/radio-host-fired-espn-maria-taylor/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
If you’re traveling for the holidays, now is the time to book flights,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/holiday-travel-book-covid-christmas-thanksgiving-flights/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
In the old days experts advised that late September through the end of October was the best time to book Thanksgiving and holiday flights if you were looking for the best deals. If you missed that window you could find low outlier fares though it was tricky. But like many things in 2020 this rule of thumb does not apply during the pandemic. “With regards to the best time to book — things have changed” says Mark Crossey the director of sales at Skyscanner. “From a price point generally speaking it is competitive for travelers at the moment.” [What to know about getting tested for the coronavirus to travel] With air travel demand down considerably (by more than half the travelers compared with 2019) airlines are offering very low ticket fares to bring customers back. “In normal times traveling over the holidays is one of the most expensive times of year to fly alongside of middle of summer” says Scott Keyes founder of Scott’s Cheap Flights. But this year Keyes says his company has seen significantly cheaper Christmas and New Year’s flights than in the past. Before the pandemic travelers knew they had to get home for the holidays no matter what. There are about a million holiday movies lampooning our desperate attempts to make it back in time for Christmas. “This year there’s a little bit more uncertainty a little bit more trepidation” Keyes says. For that reason many travelers are holding off on making their holiday bookings. Crossey says 46 percent of trips booked recently on Skyscanner are departing within 14 days. “The trend is definitely moving towards more last minute as opposed to six months in advance” he says. “People are probably aware that prices are competitive and they want to really check ‘Okay how is the country managing pandemic? Are things still open?’ If so they’ll look and then they’ll go.” Because fewer people are booking holiday travel well in advance Keyes says airlines are significantly slashing holiday airfare prices. Unlike before the pandemic major airlines have removed change fees for domestic flights. “You have the dynamic of airlines offering free changes giving people much more flexibility” Keyes says. Crossey says travelers may have a stronger incentive to book now because they know they won’t lose money if they need to change their flight later whether because of pandemic restrictions or general unease with traveling. While deals are great now Crossey says that doesn’t mean there won’t be more later. There could be sporadic deals or sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But for now “all we can see is prices are good tickets are very flexible.” He also notes travelers can shop around for airlines with the best coronavirus precautions in place. While 2020 is wholly different for travel Keyes’s life motto still applies for pandemic holiday travel: Book when there’s a cheap flight. “I don’t say that to be flip but it’s more understanding that there’s not a set-in-stone date when fares are going to be cheapest” Keyes says.

At hearing on paying college athletes, Republicans say Congress should stay out of it,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/ncaa-senate-hearing-compensation/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said compensating college athletes would be a “huge mistake” and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said “it’s a terrible rotten no good idea to federalize college sports.”“The worst thing would be for the Congress itself to write the rules” said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) chair of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee which held the hearing. “If anybody has watched 15 or 20 senators try to agree on a press release imagine what 535 members of Congress would be like trying to write detailed rules.”While the NCAA has conceded that some consideration for use of athletes’ names images and likenesses is inevitable some lawmakers still have reservations about athletes pocketing any money. Alexander for instance said sponsorship money athletes receive should be redistributed to benefit their schools’ teams and athletes.“It would avoid the awkwardness of a center who earns nothing snapping the ball to a quarterback who earns a half-million dollars for promoting the local auto dealer” he said. “… If you want to keep the money and be someone‘s employee then go join a professional team.”Other lawmakers broached the possibility of an independent third party or the Federal Trade Commission providing oversight. They also explored what limits and guardrails should be in place. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) floated the possibility of capping endorsement money at $50000.But the hearing the third time in recent months Congress has taken up the issue largely made clear how much opposition remains particularly among some Republicans to the idea of federal regulation.“Be careful what you wish for” Paul said. “The history of government regulation is not a benign one.”Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) has said a power imbalance and racial inequities are built into the current system which he said relies on what amounts to an unpaid labor force. Schools reap huge revenue and then spend lavishly giving athletes educational opportunities but no money.“For all those in this body who believe in a free market I don’t know why we decide to keep it from athletes who are producing an incredibly and increasingly valuable service” he said during the hearing.Responding to a question from Murphy Rebecca Blank the chancellor at Wisconsin noted that she supports restrictions on coaches’ compensation but said the market keeps driving those salaries up.“You are not allowed by antitrust rules to restrict the pay of college coaches but you are allowed by current rules to restrict the compensation of athletes” Murphy responded. “That is just patently absurd to me.”Karen Dennis who coaches the track and field and cross-country teams at Ohio State also testified warning that smaller programs could be endangered if money is shared with athletes.“It would have a really devastating effect on how programs would be able to exist” she said noting that Minnesota cut its men’s track programs just last week.But Ramogi Huma executive director of the National College Players Association which has worked with state legislatures to craft bills related to name image and likeness issues pointed out that Ohio State saw more than $209 million in athletics-related revenue last year.“They can’t say that if they were to share some of that with some of the nonrevenue athletes that they suddenly have to cut all sports” he said. “You’ll get the scare tactic even from the top producers. It’s just not true.”During the hearing Alexander who is not seeking reelection noted that the Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over the issue but said the NCAA is best equipped to tackle it. “The alternatives are much worse” Alexander said.“The NCAA has absolutely failed in these areas when it comes to college athletes’ rights” he said. “That’s why we’re here.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/ncaa-senate-hearing-compensation/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Daniel Snyder files request seeking info from firm handling minority owners’ sale,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/daniel-snyder-discovery-motion-moag-company/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Moag & Company an investment firm known for handling high-profile sports transactions has been retained by the Washington Football Team’s three minority owners — Robert Rothman Dwight Schar and Frederick Smith — to find a buyer or buyers for their collective stake in the franchise estimated at 40 percent.Snyder prevailed in that request for discovery with the judge in federal district court rejecting an assertion by Comstock’s lawyers that the pursuit was a “fishing expedition.” Tuesday’s action filed in federal district court in Maryland is in similar vein explained attorney Joe Tacopina.“This is not a lawsuit against [John] Moag” Tacopina said. “It’s a filing seeking information that all ties back to the MEAWW article. We think Moag has relevant information regarding that same defamation campaign against Mr. Snyder.”John A. Moag chairman and CEO of Moag & Co. did not respond to a request to comment.The petition alleges that on or around July 9 Moag contacted a potential buyer who said he was interested in buying only a majority stake in the Washington NFL team rather than a minority share.According to the petition Moag replied that Snyder soon would be selling his interest in the team.When the potential buyer voiced skepticism the petition states Moag replied that Snyder “would have no choice but to do so soon thereafter due to negative information that would be released imminently.:”One week later the filing notes the defamatory online articles appeared.Snyder’s lawyer allege further that Moag made a similar claim to another prospective buyer after the articles appeared suggesting that Snyder would be forced to sell because of forthcoming negative articles.Moag “claimed to more than one third party that Daniel Snyder would soon be forced to sell the team based on the imminent release of negative information concerning Dan” Tacopina said.The filing requests access to emails text messages electronic and physical notes call records and other documents that would demonstrate ties with MEAWW others hostile to Snyder and any coordinated efforts to defame himThe filing also seeks to depose Moag regarding the issues outlined by Snyder’s defamation lawsuit.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/daniel-snyder-discovery-motion-moag-company/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Apple’s new watch draws attention to its health-care play,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/15/apple-event-2020-apple-watch/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The event was the second one streamed online from its Silicon Valley campus known as Apple Park since the global pandemic forced it to switch to virtual product launches. The company also unveiled updated iPads and new service bundles — but no new phone which usually drives the most interest.Apple has said its participation in the health-care industry has been aimed at helping people not necessarily to benefit its bottom line. And at the virtual event Tuesday it highlighted vignettes showing how the Apple Watch keeps people healthy even saving their lives by alerting them to heart problems.“Health-care providers insurance companies and businesses are also seeing the benefits of offering Apple Watch” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the event Tuesday. “They know it can make a big difference in the lives of their patients customers and employees.”The Apple Watch 6 the company announced will include a new sensor that can detect blood oxygen levels often called a pulse oximeter which the company said will deliver helpful information about health. Apple executive Sumbul Desai announced a new research study with the Seattle Flu Study and University of Washington that will examine the relationship between blood oxygen heart rate and the coronavirus.As sales of iPhones have until recently been declining the company has been looking for new ways to make up for lost revenue. Mainly it has done so by finding ways to sell subscriptions for music TV and cloud storage. Analysts long expected Apple to bundle those products into one offering like Microsoft did with its Office suite in the 1990s. On Tuesday Apple finally did that announcing Apple One a new subscription bundle ranging from $15 a month to $30 that includes many of its digital products. It also announced a new service for Apple Watch users called Fitness + which will cost $10 per month or $80 a year.But health care is different and Apple’s route to profitability is murky. Unlike other services Apple doesn’t charge consumers or companies for any of its health offerings other than for the watches which cost from $400 to $1500 for the most recent version. Analysts say Apple will shy away from profiting directly from the data collected by researchers and drug companies that use Apple Watches in clinical trials.On Tuesday Apple announced an inexpensive version called the Apple Watch SE which will start at $279 compared to $399 for the Apple Watch 6.While six years is a long time for the technology industry it’s a blip in the medical field where change is slow and arduous. Apple’s investment is only beginning to bear noticeable fruit and experts in the pharmaceutical industry say it could take years more for the company to become a major player in the field. As Apple builds a track record for producing reliable research based on watch data it will probably add more sensors expanding the breadth of research possible with the device. One day Apple Watches could be a common component of drug and device studies experts say even if that is a far off and ambitious goal.Apple isn’t alone in its drive into health care. Google’s Verily is making a concerted push into the clinical trial industry. Amazon which acquired prescription service PillPack and online symptom-checker Health Navigator has partnered with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to lower health costs. Microsoft’s Healthcare NExT initiative is focused on artificial intelligence in health care. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)Apple Watch wasn’t the first smartwatch or even the first health-related one. Fitbit and Jawbone pioneered the fitness tracker market and new start-ups are pushing the ball forward on hardware. Oura for instance packs a lot of health-related sensors into a simple ring. But none of those companies have Apple’s massive install base of loyal customers. Apple Watches outsell the entire Swiss watch industry according to a Strategy Analytics report.There are reasons to buy Apple Watches beyond health. For customers locked into Apple’s ecosystem they make for a nifty accessory that can adjust AirPods’ volume or unlock MacBooks without a password. Because of the sheer size of its user base Apple can corral thousands of research subjects in a short period of time.Six years in Apple Watches can detect signs of atrial fibrillation a potentially deadly heart disorder. But that detection isn’t 100 percent accurate. False positives can send patients to the doctor unnecessarily. It may take a decade or more before the watch has the kinds of sensors and hardcore research necessary to be a comprehensive health solution for customers said Gene Munster an analyst with Loup Ventures a venture capital firm making the watch as a health device a long-term bet. “I don’t think they’re close to being there. I think the current watch is limited in what it’s picking up on” he said.In the meantime Apple is earning “credibility in the industry” according to Tom Dorsett CEO of RazorMetrics a health technology company aimed at lowering prescription drug costs. Apple gained FDA clearance for its atrial fibrillation algorithm and its electrocardiogram. “If they’re investing in FDA approval they’re looking to be something more than a novelty device” he says.It could be some time before Apple Watches achieve the same footing as medical devices. For instance during Tuesday’s Apple Event Apple flashed a fine-print warning across the screen. “Blood Oxygen app measurements are not intended for medical use and are only designed for general fitness and wellness purposes” it said.Apple’s first watch announced in 2014 and released the following April came with the introduction of ResearchKit open-source software that allows medical researchers to find subjects for their studies. Using the software academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies can enroll Apple’s customers in clinical trials collecting data on Apple Watches to learn more about the human body.Apple’s ResearchKit has been used for clinical trials some of which it has announced to great fanfare. Last year the company announced three major studies on women’s health heart health and hearing. In terms of the massive amount of research constantly being conducted by drug companies and in academia Apple isn’t much of a player.In part that is because Apple Watch is limited to a subset of the population — mainly to those who also use iPhones. In the United States that’s roughly half of smartphone users. Those customers tend to be more affluent and have fewer chronic diseases that drug companies aim to treat. Apple provides Apple Watches free to many research subjects and offers discounted bulk pricing to companies conducting research. Still the sheer number of people who own Apple Watches may make it possible for researchers to find diverse groups of research subjects.When Apple launched ResearchKit there were already companies — many of them start-ups — charging for similar services. Naturally they viewed Apple as a competitor with the potential to dominate the space. “When ResearchKit came out I thought we were toast” said Matthew Amsden CEO of ProofPilot which offers software services for controlled trials. It didn’t play out that way. “I just don’t hear a lot about ResearchKit anymore. I don’t think I’ve heard about it in two years.” ProofPilot is booming Amsden says. ResearchKit is considered a niche player in the overall clinical trials industry Amsden and others in the industry say.In addition ResearchKit isn’t a full-service offering. Companies that aim to use ResearchKit for trials still must have the resources to create customized software and companies such as Thread Research and Medable have sprung up to meet that need. Large drug companies tend to opt for bespoke software with actual medical devices for traditional trials industry experts say rather than rely on ResearchKit.One executive at a major pharmaceutical company who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly said that is slowly beginning to change. The executive discussed several studies Apple is working on with pharmaceutical companies that haven’t been announced.In addition to testing the efficacy of drugs pharmaceutical companies also conduct more broad research into health. Those projects which tend to benefit from large numbers of participants are more tailored for the Apple Watch. Apple announced three new research studies at its virtual event Tuesday including one relating to asthma in partnership with the insurance company Anthem and the University of California Irvine.Apple doesn’t collect fees from researchers like it does from software developers so its path to profitability isn’t as clear. But if Apple is successful in encouraging more studies and research using Apple Watch it may benefit if the research leads to new algorithms that would allow Apple to offer useful advice to customers.“Apple doesn’t want to make money off of users’ data. If they create a large business around selling data from Apple Watch that’s a problem” Munster said. That’s because Apple markets itself as privacy-conscious and profiting from health data could hurt its image. Apple doesn’t receive data from studies that use ResearchKit when Apple is not involved in the study. But he said the data can help sell more devices. “The data is making the watch more useful and ultimately making their products more indispensable.”Correction: Apple is partnering on a research study to into whether data captured by sensors on the Apple Watch are related to early signs of respiratory illness like the coronavirus. An article on the new watch incorrectly said the tool could detect early signs of the virus.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/15/apple-event-2020-apple-watch/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
What tourists need to know about visiting New York City during the pandemic,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/new-york-city-covid-travel/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
In the early days of the pandemic New York was the focal point of the outbreak’s wrath. After shutting down for months to flatten the growth curve of the novel coronavirus the city is opening up again for residents and visitors alike. “Things have been really nice [these] past couple months especially with our numbers dropping” says Benjamin Liong Setiawan a lifestyle writer who has lived in New York for over 20 years. “It’s been nice to be able to enjoy the city again.” However that doesn’t mean New Yorkers want visitors to expect business as usual. While attractions are reopening and indoor dining is set to return at 25 percent capacity on Sept. 30 much of New York City is still closed or struggling to remain open with coronavirus precautions. Not to mention its residents are still experiencing an emotional toll. A street side market stall in China Town Manhattan. (Phillip Reed/For The Washington Post) “I think a lot of people probably did experience PTSD” Setiawan says. “All that we ask as New Yorkers is that you respect the people that live here and the rules that have been put in place so that we can keep everybody safe.” Before you plan a trip to New York familiarize yourself with restrictions by checking the government’s coronavirus website. Chris Heywood the executive vice president for global communications at NYC & Company says that people from about 30 states are required to quarantine for 14 days on reaching New York whether they’re arriving by plane car or bus. Currently people over two years old are required to wear a mask in public including on public transportation. Here’s what else to know if you’re considering traveling to New York during the pandemic. [What to know about getting tested for the coronavirus to travel] Where you can stay Whether New York City hotels stayed open throughout the pandemic or are only just beginning to reopen many are offering packages to bring in more business Heywood says. They’re also carrying out enhanced cleanings putting up sneeze guards at front desks and sometimes suspending amenities (such as restaurants and fitness centers). “It’s definitely ‘safety first'; that’s kind of the ethos of the city right now” Heywood says. The Empire State Building seen from Fifth Avenue. (Phillip Reed/For The Washington Post) Setiawan recommends finding a hotel based on what you would like to do on your trip. If your primary focus is visiting museums find accommodation uptown. “If you want to be by the water there’s 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge. It’s beautiful and has a pool and you can explore Brooklyn Heights and Dumbo and Cobble Hill” he says. [New York City can’t rebound without Broadway. And Broadway’s road back is uncertain.] What you can do If your ideal New York visit includes going to a Broadway show dancing at nightclubs or going to a concert you will want to hold off on a trip. However the government is allowing more and more businesses to reopen. To navigate the ever-changing status of businesses the city’s tourism board is keeping an updated website of what’s open and how to get tickets if needed. “There is a bevy of things to see and do right now” Heywood says. Florescent green dots instruct visitors to obey social distancing measures and follow the one way system on the High Line trail. (Phillip Reed/For The Washington Post) To reopen as safely as possible attractions have tweaked their operations in a number of ways. For example visiting the High Line trail requires getting a free timed-entry pass ahead of time. The Empire State Building is limiting its visitor capacity by 50 percent and is performing enhanced cleaning. It also advertises that during its recent renovation the building installed “state-of-the-art air purification” systems. Like the High Line guests must have reservations and will have their temperatures checked before they are permitted to enter. They must also wear face covering and observe social distancing throughout the experience. [Museums are reopening to a new audience: Locals eager to ‘travel’] As museums including the American Museum of Natural History the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art reopen “many of them obviously are following all of those social distancing rules and [doing] pre-ticketing and limiting how many people can come in” Heywood says. Setiawan is a fan of simply walking around the city and spending time in its parks like Madison Square Park Prospect Park and Washington Square Park. People gather under the arch at Washington Square Park. (Phillip Reed/For The Washington Post) He recommends setting aside hours to explore Central Park and take advantage of the free audio guides available at notable sites. The actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus narrates information about Bow Bridge for example and the actress Isabella Rossellini explains the Ramble. “If you’re uptown there is Riverside Park which is really beautiful and along the Hudson River” Setiawan says. “There’s places to ride your bike. There’s places to picnic. There are some tennis courts up there.” What you can eat and drink New York City’s bars and restaurants have been deeply wounded by the pandemic and the list of permanently closed establishments is still growing. As you visit places to eat and drink whether you’re staying there or taking your order to go be mindful of the hospitality industry’s trauma. “You’re watching someone drown — try and be a little bit more empathetic” says Sother Teague the beverage director of the world-renowned bar Amor y Amargo. Temporary outdoor seating in Doyers Street in Chinatown. (Phillip Reed/For The Washington Post) Teague’s advice to visitors who want to be respectful bargoers includes tipping well — fewer customers means fewer tips for employees who rely on the gratuities to pay rent. Plus employees are doing extra work to set up safe sidewalk accommodations. Teague also recommends getting to bars early. The city’s coronavirus restrictions require guests to leave establishments by 11 p.m. so bars need more business earlier in the evening. Finally consider ordering bottled cocktails to go if they’re available. “You can get your cocktails to go and walk around the city; you couldn’t do that prior to the pandemic. The open-container laws were different” Setiawan says. “It’s nice that that’s been relaxed a bit so you can support your favorite bars try to help people out and also have a great cocktail to go. Who doesn’t want that?” Setiawan’s favorite places to grab takeout during the pandemic have been Tappo Thin Crust Pizza and restaurants in Manhattan’s Chinatown “since they were the first restaurants to be affected due to misplaced fear and racism” he says. He recommends two restaurants: Tasty Hand-pulled Noodles; and Noodle Village for soup dumplings. Setiawan also recommends checking out a self-guided food crawl hosted by the coronavirus relief organization Send Chinatown Love. Through September the crawl highlights 13 restaurants cafes bakeries and other businesses in hopes of bring tourism back to the neighborhood. For outdoor dining Setiawan has enjoyed Marea across the street from Central Park for pasta and seafood and Rezdora. “Whenever I go there I feel like I’m going to a friend’s house because everybody’s just so lovely” he says. “The food is great but also the people are great. So it makes you want to go back and you feel like a local.” Read more: 7 questions about getting your passport right now answered The summer of canceled plans: How 14 pro travelers spent the season Traveling was once social currency.

D.C. convention center reopens amid economic hit; Virginia backlog brings one-day spike in virus deaths,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/coronavirus-dc-virginia-maryland/2020/09/15/754eef82-f759-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
In D.C. officials stressed the importance of caution but also of allowing economic activity to resume as the Walter E. Washington Convention Center reopened for the first time in about six months.The facility was among the first venues in the District to shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic. The closure in early March was symbolic of sweeping changes to city life ahead of other restrictions that followed.The city now hopes the convention center will serve as an example of how key spaces in the nation’s capital can begin to reopen safely — with a new focus on virtual events while adhering to strict health and safety guidelines.Gregory O’Dell president and chief executive of Events D.C. which manages the convention center said his organization has seen a significant financial blow. In May the city opened a hospital overflow area in the convention center to prepare for a possible surge of patients although it was never used for that purpose.“We’ve lost substantial revenue as it relates to the existing convention business that we had” O’Dell said. “From the city’s perspective even more daunting it’s been millions of dollars in economic impact that those types events actually brought to hotels and restaurants.”O’Dell and city officials said they hope virtual and hybrid events will make up a slice of that revenue loss.On Tuesday D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) was hosting a Maternal and Infant Health Summit inside the building and while presenters will use a studio inside the building participants who would otherwise attend in person will participate in virtual panel discussions and workshops.The building in downtown Washington has been refitted with temperature scanners and a slew of social distancing markers.Inside surfaces will be sprayed regularly with a disinfectant designed to target the virus. The building’s command center will use artificial intelligence to monitor those inside — alerting staff if people are gathered too closely.“We took many precautions to make sure we try to keep people safe” O’Dell said. “But we want it to be real-time and proactive throughout the event experience as well.”A report released Tuesday by the D.C. Office of the Chief Financial Officer detailed the economic toll the pandemic has taken in recent months.D.C. shed about 10 percent of its private sector jobs — about 57000 positions — between February and July a slightly higher percentage than the national average. Most of the lost D.C. jobs were in the leisure and hospitality industries which have taken a hit as tourism declines and people avoid going out.Hotel and food service employment in July was cut in half compared to a year earlier. The number of hotel room nights sold plunged 80 percent in the same period. Airline traffic in the Washington area plunged by more than 90 percent in May compared to a year earlier.But the city also saw jobs gains in some sectors such as professional technical and management services as well as federal government employment — unlike the nation as a whole which saw across-the-board decreases.D.C. officials say adequate testing will be a key factor in lifting additional restrictions noting Tuesday that more testing kits are coming to the city.D.C. officials said Tuesday that LabCorp a private testing company told the city it will increase to previous levels the number of coronavirus tests it provides after reductions in recent weeks.Chris Geldart acting director of the D.C. Department of Public Works said LabCorp approached D.C. officials in early August about reducing the number of test kits it provides citing issues with its supply chain. The city and LabCorp agreed at the time the city would receive no fewer than 8000 kits per week Geldart said — down from about 10000.“We did have a time frame where we received 8000 kits per week from LabCorp” Geldart said warning that the number could dip again depending on supply. “Just this week they told us the supply chain is opening back up and they’ll be getting 10000-plus samples per week as long as that lasts.”John Falcicchio Bowser’s chief of staff said supply disruptions have been limited as the city sees steady utilization at testing sites. He also said LabCorp has improved its turnaround time for making test results available with information usually known within three or five days — down from nearly a week earlier in the summer.In Virginia a spokeswoman for state Department of Health said Tuesday’s one-day spike of 96 reported deaths was the result of a roughly two-week backlog. The delays came not from local health departments but from the health department’s central office.The backlog “was caused by a system error that has since been addressed and will be regularly reviewed going forward” said Maria Reppas the department’s director of communications. “Due to the normal delay in the death certification process [before this backlog] we expect these individuals died over the past three to four weeks.”State health Commissioner Norman Oliver said the backlog stemmed from the reporting of certain fatalities that are identified through death certificates rather than through hospitals. Virginia’s rolling seven-day average number of daily deaths stood at eight before Tuesday’s spike.At a news conference Tuesday Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said he was pleased to see caseloads dropping in the eastern part of the state which includes Virginia Beach. Cases there had spiked in the summer travel season and Northam responded by imposing additional restrictions on the area.The governor said health officials are continuing “to keep an eye on some other regions” including Southwestern and central Virginia.Northam also announced that more than 500000 Virginians have downloaded the state’s Covidwise smartphone app used for notifying residents who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus.The greater Washington region on Tuesday reported 1607 new infections and 106 additional deaths led by the one-day reporting surge in Virginia. Virginia had 943 new cases while Maryland had 599 new cases and 10 deaths and D.C. had 65 cases and no additional deaths.Maryland’s daily death toll was its highest since Sept. 4 ending a 10-day streak in which the number of fatalities was in single digits. New York state announced this week it removed Maryland from its list of states that require a 14-day quarantine.The seven-day average of new infections Tuesday in D.C. Virginia and Maryland stood at 1634 a number that has changed little since late August.laura.vozzella@washpost.comfenit.nirappil@washpost.comPatricia Sullivan and Dana Hedgpeth contributed to this report.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/coronavirus-dc-virginia-maryland/2020/09/15/754eef82-f759-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
D.C. must spend more than $3 million on security for crime-plagued public housing,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-housing-safety-lawsuit/2020/09/15/e7fea9c6-f774-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
To end the lawsuit the housing authority agreed to a host of measures to dissuade crime at 10 complexes across the city.The most expensive requirement is to spend $2.3 million on high-definition security cameras and $935000 to upgrade lighting outside buildings.The authority must also hire 14 additional security guards and police officers to patrol the highest-crime buildings according to a consent order signed last week.In a reflection of a growing call for non-police solutions to crime in poor neighborhoods the housing agency must pay $100000 a year for violence interruption programs which involve hiring community members to resolve disagreements before they turn deadly.The housing authority also agreed to board up existing vacant units — which can attract squatters — within five business days of reaching the settlement and to abide by strict deadlines for securing vacant units and fixing broken front doors going forward.Staff must also walk through each building in the 10 housing complexes daily to ensure adherence to these measures and spot maintenance problems. Failure to comply with the settlement which is in effect for five years carries a penalty of $150 per building per day.Tyrone Garrett the executive director of the D.C. Housing Authority said his agency has already started making security upgrades.“The health and safety of our residents is extremely important to me” Garrett said in a statement. “The challenges our communities face are a collective responsibility for all of us to address and with this important joint effort we look forward to seeing continued safety improvements in these neighborhoods.”Racine (D) heralded the settlement as providing safer housing for thousands of the city’s poorest residents.He previously said the lawsuit was prompted by more than 5000 police responses to public housing buildings in 17 months.The Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia had raised concerns that Racine’s investigation and subsequent settlement focused too much on crime rather than housing conditions.“We fear that it will result in more overpolicing of communities that are already overpoliced and in the eviction of public housing residents using draconian federal one-strike law” said Amanda Korber a housing attorney with the group.Racine said he was sensitive to overpolicing concerns and his office noted the settlement requires tenants to be notified of legal options when given an eviction warning.“Here we know exactly what the tenants who are longtime residents wanted” Racine said in an interview. “We met with them time and time again and what they wanted was freedom from drug and gun nuisances nuisances that they reported to police and nuisances that interfered with their safety every day.

Smoke in D.C.’s skies traveled thousands of miles from the West Coast,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/09/15/wildfire-smoke-dc-maryland-virginia/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The smoke is fortunately suspended too far aloft (at greater than 20000 feet) to meaningfully affect the quality of the air we’re breathing near the ground. The U.S. government’s AirNow forecast calls for good air quality (code green) through Thursday.The same cannot be said for the Pacific Northwest and West Coast where air quality has been among the worst anywhere in the world for several days.But by blotting out the sun the smoke is interfering with what would have been a picture-perfect stretch of September days. If not for the fires the D.C. area would be in the middle of a short preview of the best autumn has to offer: sparkling blue skies pleasant temperatures and low humidity.Instead we have a rusty-gray smoke layer streaking over our skies.The current round of coast-to-coast smoke got a big boost around Labor Day when a number of large fires exploded across the West. Many have been burning since a freak lightning barrage struck Northern California in August but the fire crisis expanded to Oregon and Washington state in the past two weeks after a heat wave followed by a rare to record combination of dry air and strong winds.As of late Monday California’s fires in 2020 had burned at least 3.2 million acres an area equivalent to the size of Connecticut. This has sent unfathomable amounts of burned material into the atmosphere. Even calling it a coast-to-coast event undersells it somewhat as parts of the plume stretch from far west into the Pacific Ocean to the Canadian Maritimes. The plume expanded across a west-to-east band some 4000 to 5000 miles wide.With superheated air and ash rising up to 10 miles into the sky that breathtaking height helps ensure the smoke takes a ride on the jet stream. Once it does so spread is only limited by wind direction aloft and smoke concentration.Reports of thick smoke have emerged across the country.While the smoke layer in the Mid-Atlantic is much higher than it is nearer the fires making its impact near the ground minimal it is nonetheless quite stout.“Smoke coverage was about the densest most even all-day obscuration I can remember. Gray gray gray!” Robert Leffler a retired climatologist for the National Weather Service said Monday evening in an email from Damascus Md.Santiago Gassó of the University of Maryland’s Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center agreed. He is an expert in high-altitude clouds aerosols and how they are detected.“This event is larger than past ones” he wrote in a Twitter direct message.The smoke plume is exceptional in three categories Gassó wrote: “The extent of the smoke layer over the U.S. and beyond permanence of the smoke layer in time and the levels of pollution remaining so high for such long distances.”Gassó also stressed that the observation tools for such smoke plumes have been fairly limited historically with better tools coming online only over the past decade or two. It is thus difficult to make long-term comparisons.Ryan Stauffer an expert on air pollution at NASA concurred. “Quantitative context is tough. Colloquially yes this is rare” he wrote in a Twitter direct message.It’s also likely that daytime temperatures have been held back somewhat by the thick upper-level smoke.In the near term expect more smoke.“Hard to say it will go away any time soon” Stauffer wrote.While models have significant difficulty with smoky specifics the train of smoke continues from the West and a nose of higher pressure aloft into the Northeast is helping to hold it in place. Heading into the weekend a dip in the jet stream across the East should help shift the pattern around enough for some clearer days forcing the smoke southeastward.Longer term the pattern more or less reverts to the present and there is unfortunately no sign of fires ending out West.Photos of the smokeAndrew Freedman contributed to this report.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/09/15/wildfire-smoke-dc-maryland-virginia/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

(This interview has been edited for clarity and length.)Q: I would be remiss if we didn't immediately launch a conversation about "Black-ish." I'm not sure there's another show like it both a dramatic success and a history lesson. I want to start with one particular thing — the secret episode that only recently began streaming on Hulu. A: I love that you’re calling it the secret episode. I think it was the shelved episode.Q: It's about the characters dealing with President Trump being in office about a year. Your husband on the show Dre is comforting the baby and he decides to tell him this horrific fairy tale which involves this terrible man who has become president. What was it like for somebody in your position on the show a show making those kinds of statements to have that episode be made secret? A: So it was pulled and shelved and it was uncomfortable. You know we do 24 episodes a season and that episode felt unique but also perfectly within the DNA of the show. It was not so far beyond subject matter that we had addressed before. We have addressed police brutality. We addressed the election in the “Hope” episode. We’ve addressed postpartum depression. We’ve addressed spanking your children. We run the gamut. And if you write out the list of what we’ve done it wouldn’t sound like a comedy. But these are the things that we as Americans are grappling with. So when the episode was shelved when it was about to air there was a lot of confusion and I was a little bit baffled. But we also just kept working. And it wasn’t my battle. I will say though I’m grateful it is now being seen. It actually gives it more context. It actually says more now and makes you wonder why it was shelved.Q: You hosted the second night of the Democratic National Convention. Have you been a particularly political person your whole life? A: Not my whole life but in my adult life yes. I was called in during the Obama election years. When I saw him during the 2004 DNC I literally was writing down notes. I had never heard a politician speak in a way that connected so to my own personal beliefs. And I don’t think I knew at that time how personal politics were. They felt like something that was out of my reach. So for me the DNC felt like a sort of an evolution from where I already sit. The career I have is about storytelling but I’m more than an actor. I’m a producer and a founder of a hair company and a CEO. I’m an American citizen. I’m a black woman. It felt like an evolution of that messaging just in a different environment and a use of a very particular skill that as actors we have which is about storytelling translating and connecting. And so I’m grateful I could show up in that way.Q: I want to go back to "Black-ish" and the character you play Rainbow Johnson. She is smart and insecure and tries to be playful — a great mother. You don't have children so I want to understand how you figured that out and who your role models are. Obviously people know that Diana Ross is your mother. A: My mom’s a famous lady who paved a way that actually allowed me to do what I do in my career. The Diana Ross that you all know doesn’t hold a candle to the mother that I have. I have a mommy who is amazing. And I do believe that I learned how to mother because of how I was mothered. I am not an actual physical mommy who has given birth to a child but I am a very mothering human. I am a nurturer. And so I bring all that to “Black-ish.” I also will give the biggest and greatest shout-out to our writers and to [show creator] Kenya Barris. One of the things I love about Bow is that she’s a whole person. She is not one thing. She’s a mother. She’s a doctor. She’s a wife. She’s a person. She’s a daughter. She’s a friend. And it’s incredibly important to me to bring a whole person to this character.Q: In your recent movie "The High Note" you play Grace Davis an R&B diva and actually sing on-screen for the first time. Tell me about that.A: I was terrified. And I think the longer you wait to do something the scarier it gets. I think the older you get trying something new feels daunting because you know what the backlash could be. It’s like you know trying to learn to ski at 40. It seems like a dumb idea but when you’re 15 you’re like “Whatever.” But I always wanted to sing and it was a great experience. I felt like I walked through one of my biggest fears toward one of my dreams. It was complete and utter liberation and joy.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/qanda-with-tracee-ellis-ross-the-career-i-have-is-about-storytelling-but-im-more-than-an-actor/2020/09/10/4d8e868a-f211-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

D.C. auditor reviewing fatal shootings by District police,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/dc-auditor-reviewing-fatal-shootings-by-district-police/2020/09/15/c8ffd3b2-f75e-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Kay’s shooting is still under review by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia which has declined to prosecute in the other cases.Families of most of the men killed have objected to the police accounts including relatives of Kay who died when an officer fired at the same time or nearly the same time that the 18-year-old was throwing a gun. His aunt has maintained that Kay was unarmed when the officer pulled the trigger and demonstrators have called for the officer and police chief to be fired.The review is being led by Michael R. Bromwich who served as the court-appointed monitor overseeing a D.C. police memorandum of agreement with the Justice Department in 2001 after officers had shot and killed more people per capita than in any other large city.That memorandum aimed at reducing police use of force expired in 2008. In 2016 the Bromwich Group commissioned by the D.C. auditor conducted a follow-up inquiry and concluded that the number of incidents of excessive force and shootings by officers remained low. “There is no evidence that the [police department] has an excessive use-of-force problem” Bromwich said at the time.In a five-year span in the late 1990s D.C. police fatally shot 57 people with 640 shooting incidents. From 2015 through 2019 D.C. police fatally shot 11 people with 114 shooting incidents. This year police have shot four people Kay being the lone fatality.D.C. Auditor Kathleen Patterson said she initially hoped to have a report from Bromwich in October but it may take longer because of the shooting of Kay.In a statement Patterson said Bromwich will examine the incidents in the context of the memorandum of agreement which prompted vast changes in rules on using force and how investigations are conducted.“It is our hope that this review will contribute constructively to the national and District conversations on policing overall and police use of force” her statement said.Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against officers in the deaths of Carter Young Price and Alston and Kay’s shooting remains under review. The police department which conducts separate internal investigations found that the officers involved in the shootings of Young and Alston acted within department policy. The officer involved in Price’s death was briefly suspended after the crash was ruled “preventable” because the officer failed to stop for a stop sign before entering the intersection.The internal police review involving the death of Kay has not been resolved. D.C. police did not respond to questions on the status of the inquiry in Carter’s case. Police also did not immediately comment on the auditor’s investigation.The chairman of the D.C. police union Gregg Pemberton stressed that most of the cases being reviewed have already undergone scrutiny by federal prosecutors and the police department’s Use of Force Review Board.“It’s almost like city officials are disappointed that the dispositions have not resulted in a finding of police misconduct” Pemberton said Tuesday. “Unfortunately for the anti-police pro-crime advocates our members are well-trained and have acted appropriately in these situations.”He said he is confident that Patterson and Bromwich will reach the same conclusion they did in 2016.The auditor’s review began in July one month before the first meeting of the D.C. Council’s Police Reform Commission made up of 20 people trying to reimagine the future of policing in the District following violent and sometimes deadly encounters involving law enforcement in cities across the country.At an emergency meeting two days after Kay was killed members of the newly formed commission demanded police release body-camera video from all of the officers at the scene and called for an independent investigation into the shooting. The department complying with a new D.C. Council law made public only the video from the officer who fired.Members said they wanted to see additional perspectives of the shooting and city leaders who attended the meeting agreed to seek advice from legal counsel and perhaps let the commission view additional videos in private.But at the commission’s meeting Monday members learned that questions about additional videos and others regarding the shooting would be delivered to Patterson whose office would make the inquiries of police.That frustrated some members. Mignon Smith a former school principal said the commission was promised an answer only to learn now that the questions have been “turned over to the hands of someone else.”The group’s co-chair Christy Lopez director of the Innovative Policing Program at Georgetown Law who led Justice Department investigations of police abuse in Ferguson Mo. said the commission had requested an independent review into Kay’s death and that is what the D.C. auditor is doing.Lopez said the commission is trying to look into broader issues of police conduct and practices alternatives to sending officers to certain calls whether police should be in schools restorative justice issues and discipline.The alternative Lopez said is “we spend all of our time on this one very important incident and we don’t get at the root of the underlying issues that we all want to get to to prevent similar incidents.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/dc-auditor-reviewing-fatal-shootings-by-district-police/2020/09/15/c8ffd3b2-f75e-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Review | Walter Mosley changes gears with ‘The Awkward Black Man,’ a meditation on health, aging and life,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/walter-mosley-changes-gears-with-the-awkward-black-man-a-meditation-on-health-aging-and-life/2020/09/14/21cd08c4-f693-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Mosley who was just awarded a lifetime achievement award from the National Book Foundation has so many titles to his name that one could tire of eating carryout too often. But “The Awkward Black Man” is different. Mosley’s stories seem to overlap when it comes to the type of Black men he writes about. In this collection the men are usually over 50. They have physical shortcomings when it comes to being attractive to women and love triangles abound. There are moments when one might prefer basic arithmetic to geometry.Mosley’s men are working class and “first rung” middle-class bank types. At times their actions are misunderstood. In “Pet Fly” Rufus Coombs’s giving of gifts to a fellow employee is interpreted as sexual harassment. Albert Roundhouse in “Almost Alyce” is from a working-class family but things fall apart and he becomes homeless. Because of their age the men in Mosley’s world have difficulty starting over again. Their cards have been played and not even sex can provide comfort. In “Leading From the Affair” Frank Lassiter wonders “What did younger women want with older men except for security and then marriage?”If stories can be haunted by their own narrative then “The Awkward Black Man” is a must-read for the retired. Mosley explores the same themes in his fiction that the poet Donald Hall examined in his memoirs. How does one squeeze words into that last cup of tenderness?One of the best stories in this book “The Letter” explores the different degrees of life from infidelities to suicide and in relationships not just with women but between fathers and sons. Mosley’s reference to “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel Garcia Marquez carries the story forward blessing his fiction like holy water in the back of a cathedral. “The Letter” is what one reads after listening to “Kind of Blue” by the Miles Davis sextet. One classic deserves another.But where one might find a glossary or appendix in a nonfiction book Mosley closes with “An Unlikely Series of Conversations.” This short story is what might be considered a “coaster” something you include in a collection simply to prevent a stain on the table. What doesn’t work are the references to race and identity. The character Laertes Jackson sounds too much like Cornel West without a suit. What can make African American literature “awkward” is when race becomes the center of things and we only see the sun and not the moon.What shouldn’t be overlooked before putting the book down is the gem “The Black Woman in the Chinese Hat.” Here is Rufus Coombs again and here is Walter Mosley perhaps leaving clues and creating a mystery between two short stories. Is it the same Rufus? This story is so nice and New York that Rufus and the woman Chai eventually find themselves on the Staten Island Ferry. The sex between them is as casual as their conversation earlier in the day. When Mosley ends this story Chai’s touch lingers.“The Awkward Black Man” is a collection that meditates on health aging and life. It’s the type of book that can restore one’s balance without a cane.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/walter-mosley-changes-gears-with-the-awkward-black-man-a-meditation-on-health-aging-and-life/2020/09/14/21cd08c4-f693-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
School, but an ‘undead version’: Students, parents and teachers in Northern Virginia adjust to online learning,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/school-but-an-undead-version-students-parents-and-teachers-in-northern-virginia-adjust-to-online-learning/2020/09/15/f3ea7cd0-f75e-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“Margie went into the schoolroom . . . and the mechanical teacher was on and waiting for her” the passage reads. “The screen was lit up and it said: ‘Today’s arithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper fractions. Please insert yesterday’s homework in the proper slot.’ Margie did so with a sigh.”These days Bradley — who teaches middle school in Fairfax County Public Schools — feels a lot like the “mechanical teacher.” He spends every morning huddled in a spare room in his Northern Virginia home staring at his computer screen. The monitor is filled with small rectangles: Each one depicts an anonymous identical silhouette.These Bradley explained are his students. Most keep their cameras off.“Sometimes” he said “you feel as if you’re speaking to thin air. Or to no one at all.”One week into remote schooling students parents and teachers throughout Northern Virginia — where all major public school districts are conducting online-only learning — are slowly adjusting to their new virtual reality. The first week of school-from-a-distance saw no massive technological or privacy failures according to interviews with more than two dozen educators parents and students. Just a whole lot of bizarre.“School is back” texted one Fairfax parent. “But it seems in a kind of ‘undead’ version.”There were some hiccups. Just before school launched on Sept. 8 Fairfax which serves 189000 students was hit with a ransomware attack. A group of hackers claimed to have stolen staff information. The incident now being investigated by the FBI did not disrupt online lessons for most students and teachers.Arlington Public Schools struggled with its technology on the first day of learning leaving many of its 28000 students unable to log into class using school-issued devices. Schools Superintendent Francisco Durán attributed the problem to officials’ failure to prepare for the high volume of simultaneous log-ins and the school system resolved the problem — for the most part — by the next day.And in Loudoun County Public Schools which enrolls 83000 some classrooms saw bad behavior. Spokesman Rob Doolittle said teachers in the school system reported racist or sexually inappropriate acts in 10 classrooms spanning six different schools. Officials are still exploring the misconduct and determining appropriate punishment but they are confident that the perpetrators were students.Still bigger issues — such as the lack of Internet and devices that kept thousands from learning last spring — did not surface. School officials throughout Northern Virginia worked all summer to ensure that families could get online in the fall. Staffers delivered iPads Chromebooks and WiFi hotspots; school systems partnered with county governments and service providers to extend Internet to more households.In interviews teachers in the districts said they were thrilled to see almost all of their students pop in to every class.“It’s been incredibly good attendance” said Fairfax’s Bradley who said he missed connecting with just two children. “I think the school did a wonderful job chasing students down.”Danielle Thorne a high school geometry teacher in Alexandria said only three of her students have so far failed to show up — out of 75 she is teaching.“I was nervous about that” Thorne said. “So I’m happily surprised that the kids are all there and they’re all doing their work in class and out of class.”The basics largely taken care of most are confronting the next key question: Can kids actually learn online?Abigail Herrada 16 said she thinks she can — so long as she hides her phone.Herrada who attends high school in Arlington started throwing her iPhone across the room before class began. Then she began stowing it in another room entirely.“In the past you had to sneak your phone into class and you could only be on it for a few minutes” she said. “But now you can be on it the entire class time and the teacher won’t notice so it can be hard to avoid the distractions.”But there are advantages too: Like the fact she can roll straight out of bed throw on a sweatshirt and be at school. She can use the bathroom without having to ask permission. And she can snack anytime she likes — although she makes sure to turn her camera off while she’s eating which she guesses is what counts for courtesy during the coronavirus pandemic.Lorraine Lundqvist a Loudoun parent also said she thinks online school works for her two boys an eighth-grader and a high school senior.Lundqvist who is 52 and works from home running a small consulting company transformed her family’s basement to serve as a virtual classroom. It didn’t take too much: She purchased two stand-or-sit desks from Ikea. Now her boys spend their days learning side-by-side using headphones.Throughout the first week Lundqvist popped downstairs every few hours. She peered in silently then raised a tentative thumbs-up: Are you guys good?“Every time they turned and gave me a thumbs-up back” Lundqvist said. “My kids are engaging with their teachers. They’re learning. I think it’s because the teachers are really really putting a lot of effort forward and the kids are picking up on that.”In fact Lundqvist said she thinks online school might be a boon for her younger son: He had struggled to adjust to middle school disliking the way that other boys shoved each other on the bus or spoke crassly about drugs and girls.“The very first day” Lundqvist said “my youngest son turned to me afterward and said: ‘I love this.’ ”For others though the first week brought an unwelcome realization: that their carefully plotted learn-from-home setups just weren’t going to work.Deanna Caputo 43 has two children enrolled in Arlington schools: a kindergartner and a fourth-grader. She had set them up with learning spaces in their Arlington Forest home but the kindergartner broke down in tears of frustration on her first day. On the fourth day her son suddenly began sobbing.“He just looked at me he didn’t know what to say and he couldn’t explain it” she said. “I asked ‘How are you feeling inside? Are you angry? Are you sad?’ And he was just lonely.”Now her daughter is in a professional pod run by a day-care center which is costing Caputo $1000 a month. And she joined with two other families in her son’s class to create a more informal pod for him which is free.Some educators also had to make adjustments. Thorne the Alexandria teacher said she soon learned that online teaching demands more detailed precise instructions than in-person school did.Elsewhere in Fairfax veteran high school English teacher Theresa Poquis started the week feeling odd and impersonal. How she asked herself could she possibly get to know a screen full of rectangles?Then during the final period on Friday she had an idea.Poquis 52 sent her students into small “breakout rooms” for discussion. When they returned to the main video classroom she sent everyone a link promising it would lead to an instructional slide. Instead the link sent the teenagers to Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” on YouTube — a prank known as “rick-rolling.”“They just started laughing and screaming and saying ‘OMG she just rick-rolled us!’ ‘I can’t believe it!’ ” Poquis said. “They were hysterical.”So was she. It was her best laugh she said of the entire pandemic.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/school-but-an-undead-version-students-parents-and-teachers-in-northern-virginia-adjust-to-online-learning/2020/09/15/f3ea7cd0-f75e-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Experts offer advice on how to create a well-stocked home first-aid kit,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/experts-offer-advice-on-how-to-create-a-well-stocked-home-first-aid-kit/2020/09/14/b9f65026-e6f1-11ea-bc79-834454439a44_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
That said you don’t need an entire pharmacy at your house.“Never underestimate the value of warm soap and water clean Band-Aids and basic medicines for pain fever nasal congestion and cold and flu” said Alexei Wagner an emergency medicine physician at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto Calif.We spoke with four physicians about what should be in your home kit. The contents will vary depending on your activities and lifestyle. Here are their general suggestions for creating a well-stocked home arsenal — without overbuying.Medications to treat basic ailments — with appropriate dosages. Keep a variety of medicines to treat common illnesses on hand said John Balmes professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of California at San Francisco’s medical school. Some basics he suggests stocking: antacids and antidiarrheal medicines; oral antihistamines such as Benadryl; hydrocortisone cream for skin reactions; laxatives; and cough medicine. Medications to treat inflammation relieve pain and reduce fevers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen belong in your kit too. Individually packaged doses and chewable medications are convenient when you’re in a hurry.Choose formulations that are appropriate for your family. Wagner has three children under 6 so he keeps children’s dosages and liquid medicines on hand. “I always have liquid acetaminophen Benadryl and powdered Pedialyte because dehydrated kids are usually unhappy” he said. In addition to rehydrating kids with stomach or intestinal viruses Pedialyte can boost liquids in children with fevers or other illnesses he said.Supplies for injuries. Antiseptic solution alcohol wipes or sterile saline solution are useful to sanitize cuts and scrapes and kill germs that could cause infections Balmes said. Saline eye wash can help flush irritants from eyes too.Balmes suggests including tools in your kit for various situations. Scissors and tweezers are helpful for cutting bandages or removing insect stingers and splinters. Cotton balls and swabs can be used to cover wounds and apply disinfectants or ointments. Non-latex disposable gloves help keep both injured areas and your hands clean. Balmes also suggests stocking padded aluminum finger splints plus duct tape; the versatile product’s durability is especially useful when creating a splint or bandage from scratch he said but don’t put duct tape directly on skin.Also include supplies specific to injuries you could sustain doing your hobbies. Someone who hikes frequently for example should have blister packs as well as tape and splints to treat sprains.Treatments for cuts burns scrapes and bumps. Supplies that stop bleeding such as gauze and Band-Aids in various sizes and shapes and a tourniquet for more extreme situations are essentials in any kit said Eileen Bulger chief of trauma at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle and co-founder of Stop the Bleed. “Bleeding is the number one cause of preventable death after injury” said Bulger who heads the hospital’s Level 1 trauma center.A tourniquet is helpful because bleeding can progress quickly. Bulger’s organization offers courses to teach people how to administer care to stanch bleeding including how to use a tourniquet properly. “You shouldn’t get things you’re not comfortable using” she said.Keep antibiotic ointments to deal with cuts or mild burns. Even minor burns can be debilitating and require medical treatment Bulger said depending on where they are. And items don’t have to be fancy. A bag of frozen peas works as an ice pack to prevent swelling after a fall she said.Include instructions for using your kit and important information in case of emergency. The most important piece of your kit isn’t an object Wagner said. Preparation and planning can make the difference between a costly emergency room visit in the middle of the night and a next-day appointment or telemedicine session covered by your insurance company. “It’s hard to make those decisions when you’re worried and panicked” he said.Gather contact information for physicians and insurance companies and include instructions for prescriptions and how to use lifesaving items such as an EpiPen. Preselect trusted websites to turn to for guidance which could include Web pages for your state and local health authorities and medical provider. Balmes also recommends keeping a first-aid manual at home and in any kit you travel with.At-home care isn’t a substitute for professional care. Remember: Your first-aid kit does not replace trained medical care. “First aid is either for minor injuries that you don’t need to go to the hospital for or for temporizing while you’re trying to transport to the hospital” Balmes said. Injuries that leave you immobilized or cause severe pain or a change in mental status are urgent and require immediate care. Balmes adds shortness of breath to that list too in light of the pandemic.Keeping supplies at home will make it easier to seek medical care said Carolyn Kaloostian assistant professor of family medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine.“To truly treat viruses you need to see a doctor but you can provide relief and comfort with over-the-counter medicines” she said. Kaloostian who also specializes in geriatric medicine suggests having a scale blood pressure cuff and thermometer on hand to gather vital information that can give your doctor a fuller picture of your condition and help pinpoint treatment options.“Knowing basic information helps your doctor quickly eliminate and tailor possibilities especially if you’re seeking care remotely” Kaloostian said.Consider how first aid at home relates to the pandemic. Experts have warned about the challenges of the oncoming flu season colliding with the coronavirus particularly because many mild virus cases present with flu-like symptoms. To prepare Wagner recommends stocking fever and anti-inflammatory medicines researching how testing and treatment for the coronavirus works in your area and with your doctor and getting a flu shot. “If you do get symptoms take the recommended precautions until you can see a doctor and get tested” Wagner said.The doctors we spoke with encourage people to get medical care if needed. Bulger Wagner and Kaloostian noted that the pandemic has made telemedicine more widely available and that hospitals and care facilities have developed and streamlined safety procedures in the months since the pandemic began.“People should not be afraid to come to the hospital to seek treatment” Bulger said.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/experts-offer-advice-on-how-to-create-a-well-stocked-home-first-aid-kit/2020/09/14/b9f65026-e6f1-11ea-bc79-834454439a44_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

A pecan-crusted trout that’s baked,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/09/15/a-pecan-crusted-trout-thats-baked-not-fried-satisfies-that-craving-for-buttery-crispy-fish/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Overview Ingredients Steps Overview I love a fried fish fillet but sometimes can’t face the mess: the egg wash the flour/cornmeal coating and the skillet of hot oil. So when that craving strikes especially on a weeknight I turn instead to the oven and rather than flour or cornmeal I coat the fillets in finely ground nuts. [Deceptively easy elegant trout amandine really does come together in less than 30 minutes] After a fishing trip my brother Michael’s wife Dorothy made this dish with the trout we had just caught in Lake Pontchartrain and Louisiana pecans. I’ve been making it that way ever since. Most of us have heard of trout amandine a fish topped with toasted almonds in a meunière sauce. The idea of swapping in pecans likely was popularized at Commander’s Palace. In a 2007 article in the Times-Picayune Alex Brennan of the family that has long operated the restaurant says the idea was born after an exchange between his uncle and mother: “I will never forget this great conversation I heard between mom (Ella) and Uncle Dick about trout amandine: ‘We’ve got pecans literally growing in our own backyard. Why are we putting almonds from California on our fish?’ “And thus was born trout pecan. I was standing there when it happened.” The dish remains a staple at the restaurant. I swap in pecans for almonds sometimes as well when making a similar dish but that preparation while tasty does not satisfy my urge for a fish fillet with a crunchy crust. When I want that I pulse the pecans in a food processor until they are finely ground. Then I toss those fatty nuts with a little cornstarch and dried seasonings to create the coating. To help the nut mixture adhere to the fish — any firm-fleshed white fish from tilapia to drum will do — I brush the fillets with melted butter or a Dijon mustard. Then I press the nuts into the fillets on both sides lay them on a greased baking sheet and slip them into the oven. If I’m feeling fancy I’ll make an herby brown butter sauce to go on top. The nuts already are quite fatty so a squeeze of fresh lemon on its own is great as well. [Top 10 summer recipes: Our readers’ favorites include meatless nostalgic and quick picks] What I love about the recipe besides its flavor and ease is that it solves a few problems often cited as reasons for not cooking fish: The fatty nut-crust keeps the fish moist so no drying out. The fillets are cooked in the oven on a baking sheet so there is no need to flip the delicate pieces. And finally oven-baked fish often is less fishy smelling than cooking on the stovetop. You can serve the full fillets as pictured here but that is an indulgence because that big piece of fish is coated with almost a half-cup of nuts. For smaller appetites and less fat consider halving the fillets and adding more green beans or a salad to the plate. Refrigerate any leftover fillets in a parchment-lined flat airtight container. To reheat place on a lightly oiled baking sheet in a 350-degree oven for about 10 minutes. Scale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here. Ingredients FOR THE FISH 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 4 (6- to 8-ounce) skin-off trout fillets or any firm white-fleshed fish 2 cups (8 ounces) raw pecans 1/4 cup cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (optional) 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Lemon wedges for serving (optional) FOR THE BEANS 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound French green beans trimmed and patted dry (defrosted if frozen) 2 cloves garlic minced or finely grated 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes FOR THE SAUCE 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons minced fresh herbs such as parsley sage rosemary or thyme Steps Step 1 Position the rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Grease a large rimmed baking sheet with oil. Place the fish on a plate and pat it dry with a paper towel. Step 2 In a food processor grind the pecans until finely chopped. Transfer the nuts to a shallow dish add the cornstarch and toss to combine. Season with the pepper garlic powder paprika and lemon zest and stir to combine. Step 3 Working with one fillet at a time brush the fish with the mustard then coat the fish on both sides with the pecan mixture pressing the mixture in to cover. Transfer the coated fish to the baking sheet and repeat with the remaining fish and coating ingredients. Bake without flipping for about 25 minutes or until just golden brown. Do not overbake. Step 4 Make the green beans: While the fish is baking in a large skillet over medium-high heat heat 2 teaspoons oil until shimmering. Add the green beans and cook stirring often until they begin to blister and brown in spots 5 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic and pepper flakes and toss together for about 1 minute. Transfer the beans to a platter. Step 5 Make the sauce: Just before serving in a light-colored small skillet over medium heat melt the butter stirring constantly until it browns and smells nutty 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat then add the lemon juice and your herb of choice and swirl in the pan to combine. Place a quarter of the green beans on each plate top with a fish fillet and drizzle the butter sauce over. Serve immediately with lemon wedges if desired. Recipe from recipes editor Ann Maloney.

Have you met tamarind? If you say no you might not even know you’ve had it. Though tamarind trees are originally from Africa they’ve since spread all over South and Southeast Asia as well as become prominent in those regions’ respective cuisines. Tamarind bean pods grow green then brown with brittle papery shells encasing sticky deep brown pulp. The pulp itself is sweet and sour with citrusy notes. If you’ve ever tried brown chutney alongside your samosas that’s Tamarind Chutney providing a sour tang. Tamarind might also be the secret to your favorite pad thai. It’s even an ingredient in Worcestershire sauce! [Bring bold Thai flavors to your cooking with these 6 recipes] If you want to try cooking with tamarind you can use it as a block or jar of paste as concentrate as a powder or in the pods themselves.

Opinion | The military is providing an unexpected and powerful line of defense against Russian interference,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-military-is-providing-an-unexpected-and-powerful-line-of-defense-against-russian-interference/2020/09/15/6fafbb86-f779-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
But there’s a backstop: The U.S. Cyber Command is quietly pushing ahead with the effort it began two years ago to “defend forward” against Russian influence operations — which means getting inside Russian cybernetworks to detect and disrupt attacks.Cyber Command’s operations against Russia in recent months have been “very aggressive and very effective” said one defense official — to the point that they’ve disoriented some Russian operations planners. Thanks to these efforts it will be “virtually impossible” for the Russians or anyone else to penetrate voting systems in the roughly 8000 jurisdictions around the country the defense official said.When it comes to the Russian election threat Washington is a tale of two cities. Military commanders are doing their jobs independently and professionally. Political appointees in civilian agencies appear to be more susceptible to White House pressure. For a vivid illustration of the difference compare two documents that emerged over the past month.First take a look at the article published in Foreign Affairs on Aug. 25 by Gen. Paul M. Nakasone the Cyber Command chief and Michael Sulmeyer his senior adviser. They wrote that Cyber Command has expanded the “hunt forward” strategy that “disrupted a concerted effort to undermine the midterm elections” in 2018. They pledged: “Together with its partners Cyber Command is doing all of this and more for the 2020 elections.”Nakasone bluntly told a House committee in March that Russia’s “willingness to launch destructive cyber operations and pervasive influence campaigns . . . remains the top concern when it comes to the 2020 elections.”Measuring Cyber Command’s success is impossible. We don’t know what the Russians or others are planning this year or whether they’ve been deterred. But the public commitment by Nakasone who has strong backing from Gen. Mark A. Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should give the public some confidence in the integrity of our election system. In the end this public trust is the key ingredient.Now look at a second document disclosed Sept. 8 by the House Intelligence Committee about alleged political interference at DHS. It’s a whistleblower complaint from Brian Murphy the DHS official who oversaw intelligence and analysis until he was fired in August. In the blur of news this month Murphy’s complaint hasn’t received the attention it deserves.Murphy charged that in mid-May this year DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf instructed him “to cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran.” When Murphy protested to his superiors Wolf reiterated on July 8 that the intelligence about Russia should be “held” because it “made the President look bad” according to the complaint.Murphy was dumped after allegations that DHS had improperly gathered information about peaceful protesters in Portland Ore. and elsewhere. But his complaint suggests that he was a political fall guy. Murphy said in the complaint that he wasn’t aware of any such surveillance actions and that he would have refused to authorize them — but that Wolf told him his reassignment “would be politically good for Mr. Wolf.”Wolf has rejected the whistleblower’s allegations. “We’ve been very clear about making sure that we call out Russia” he told Fox News. It’s true that DHS has maintained a strong election security program — supervised by Christopher C. Krebs head of its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency — which maintains close contact with Cyber Command. But Wolf’s behavior undermines confidence in DHS’s political independence.Trump’s campaign of denial on Russian activities has been relentless. He fired Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and his successor Joseph Maguire. His appointees sought to prevent intelligence agencies from providing public briefings about Russian meddling. It’s unnerving that Trump remains so protective of the Kremlin to this day.With fewer than 50 days until the election what safeguard does America have against foreign adversaries who would exploit our current divisions? The best protection is a responsible electorate. But it’s reassuring that our military — which swears its oath to the Constitution not to any individual — has our backs.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-military-is-providing-an-unexpected-and-powerful-line-of-defense-against-russian-interference/2020/09/15/6fafbb86-f779-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Opinion | Thanks to the Trump administration, one QAnon theory is panning out,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/trump-has-exposed-deep-state-it-is-him/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Neither does it seem to be the case that Austin Steinbart a man many once believed to be “Q” had prophetic insight into the inner workings of the U.S. government because he received messages from his future self through quantum computing. Steinbart recently jailed for violating the terms of his pre-trial release on extortion charges had in his possession a prosthetic penis called a “Whizzinator” used for falsifying drug tests the Daily Beast’s Will Sommer reports.Nor was Hillary Clinton imprisoned in October 2017 as Q had promised — though it cannot be ruled out that the real Clinton as some QAnon adherents hold was indeed arrested and the one walking free today is a clone.The world is likewise yet to see evidence that the U.S. government is run by reptilian aliens (Stephen Miller aside) that many in the federal government worship Satan that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is a CIA puppet or that liberal elites stay young by drinking a substance called “adrenochrome” that they derive from the blood of children they hold in captivity as part of a pedophilia ring.But in one respect QAnon theory is panning out. There is indeed a sinister cabal trying to manipulate the U.S. government in ways that harm the American people.It is called the Trump administration.On Sunday Michael Caputo an assistant secretary of public affairs for the Department of Health and Human Services and a key manager of the Trump administration’s public messaging about the pandemic declared on Facebook Live that government scientists were engaging in “sedition” with the pandemic and that armed left-wing hit squads were preparing for a post-election insurrection. As the New York Times and others reported Caputo also said his “mental health has definitely failed” and he was seeing “shadows on the ceiling in my apartment there alone shadows are so long.” He apologized to colleagues on Tuesday.Last Thursday Roger Stone a longtime Trump confidant whose prison sentence was commuted after he offered to help with Trump’s reelection said federal marshals should seize and discard election ballots in Nevada that Justice Department officers should physically block people from voting and that if Trump loses he should consider declaring martial law and arresting Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg Apple’s Tim Cook the Clintons former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and the staff of the Daily Beast.And Trump himself on Monday visiting the fire-ravaged West Coast dismissed the very notion that climate change exists saying “I don’t think science knows” and “it’ll start getting cooler — you just you just watch.” He previously said the “deep state” was slowing vaccine progress at the Food and Drug Administration.All fit neatly with key QAnon tenets that scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have fueled the pandemic to harm Trump that Trump will arrest and execute political opponents based on now-secret indictments in an operation called the “Storm” and that climate change is a hoax designed to enrich left-wing interests.This follows Trump’s embrace of QAnon adherents last month as “people that love our country” and the many times he and those around him have shared or promoted QAnon-linked accounts and ideas on social media or invited QAnon personalities to the White House. In July former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn posted a video of himself reciting a QAnon oath. Twenty-one QAnon adherents will be representing the Republican Party on congressional ballots in November Media Matters reports.Forgive my conspiracy theorizing but it sounds as though QAnon has performed a secret coup of its own. Et tu Q?Devotees of QAnon fantasies have done real-world damage. Authorities in Oregon are battling not just wildfires but a rash of calls to 911 dispatchers claiming the Q-promoted falsehood that “antifa” militants had set the forest fires. As Yahoo News reported the FBI warned that QAnon theories will at times inspire “criminal or violent acts.” QAnon adherents have allegedly committed crimes coast to coast.From the anonymity of the Dark Web QAnon offers something for every suspicious mind. It embraces anti-Semites anti-vaxxers 9/11 truthers and anybody who believes the military Democrats the media Hollywood the Catholic Church banks or industry are perpetrating murders trafficking enslavement or a coup.There has always been such paranoia. The difference now is it has been validated by the president and his family appointees and advisers. Trump has exposed the deep state and it is him.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/trump-has-exposed-deep-state-it-is-him/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Pro-Trump youth group enlists teens in secretive campaign likened to a ‘troll farm,’ prompting rebuke by Facebook and Twitter,headline,https://washingtonpost.com/politics/turning-point-teens-disinformation-trump/2020/09/15/c84091ae-f20a-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html?tid=pm_pop&itid=pm_pop,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The messages have been emanating in recent months from the accounts of young people in Arizona seemingly expressing their own views — standing up for President Trump in a battleground state and echoing talking points from his reelection campaign.Far from representing a genuine social media groundswell however the posts are the product of a sprawling yet secretive campaign that experts say evades the guardrails put in place by social media companies to limit online disinformation of the sort used by Russia during the 2016 campaign.Teenagers some of them minors are being paid to pump out the messages at the direction of Turning Point Action an affiliate of Turning Point USA the prominent conservative youth organization based in Phoenix according to four people with independent knowledge of the effort. Their descriptions were confirmed by detailed notes from relatives of one of the teenagers who recorded conversations with him about the efforts.The campaign draws on the spam-like behavior of bots and trolls with the same or similar language posted repeatedly across social media. But it is carried out at least in part by humans paid to use their own accounts though nowhere disclosing their relationship with Turning Point Action or the digital firm brought in to oversee the day-to-day activity. One user included a link to Turning Point USA’s website in his Twitter profile until The Washington Post began asking questions about the activity.In response to questions from The Post Twitter on Tuesday suspended at least 20 accounts involved in the activity for “platform manipulation and spam.” Facebook also removed a number of accounts as part of what the company said is an ongoing investigation.The effort generated thousands of posts this summer on Twitter Facebook and Instagram according to an examination by The Post and an assessment by an independent specialist in data science. Nearly 4500 tweets containing identical content that were identified in the analysis probably represent a fraction of the overall output.The months-long effort by the tax-exempt nonprofit is among the most ambitious domestic influence campaigns uncovered this election cycle said experts tracking the evolution of deceptive online tactics.“In 2016 there were Macedonian teenagers interfering in the election by running a troll farm and writing salacious articles for money” said Graham Brookie director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “In this election the troll farm is in Phoenix.”The effort Brookie added illustrates “that the scale and scope of domestic disinformation is far greater than anything a foreign adversary could do to us.”Turning Point Action whose 26-year-old leader Charlie Kirk delivered the opening speech at this year’s Republican National Convention issued a statement from the group’s field director defending the social media campaign and saying any comparison to a troll farm was a “gross mischaracterization.”“This is sincere political activism conducted by real people who passionately hold the beliefs they describe online not an anonymous troll farm in Russia” the field director Austin Smith said in the statement.He said the operation reflected an attempt by Turning Point Action to maintain its advocacy despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic which has curtailed many traditional political events.“Like everyone else Turning Point Action’s plans for nationwide in-person events and activities were completely disrupted by the pandemic” Smith said. “Many positions TPA had planned for in field work were going to be completely cut but TPA managed to reimagine these roles and working with our marketing partners transitioned some to a virtual and online activist model.”The group declined to make Kirk available for an interview.The online salvo targeted prominent Democratic politicians and news organizations on social media. It mainly took the form of replies to their posts part of a bid to reorient political conversation.The messages — some of them false and some simply partisan — were parceled out in precise increments as directed by the effort’s leaders according to the people with knowledge of the highly coordinated activity most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the privacy of minors carrying out the work.One parent of two teenagers involved in the effort Robert Jason Noonan said his 16- and 17-year-old daughters were being paid by Turning Point to push “conservative points of view and values” on social media. He said they have been working with the group since about June adding in an interview “The job is theirs until they want to quit or until the election.”Four years ago the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency amplified Turning Point’s right-wing memes as part of Moscow’s sweeping interference aimed at boosting Trump according to expert assessments prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee. One report pointed specifically to the use of Turning Point content as evidence of Russia’s “deep knowledge of American culture media and influencers.”Now some technology industry experts contend that the effort this year by Turning Point shows how domestic groups are not just producing eye-catching online material but also increasingly using social media to spread it in disruptive or misleading ways.“It sounds like the Russians but instead coming from Americans” said Jacob Ratkiewicz a software engineer at Google whose academic research as a PhD student at Indiana University at Bloomington addressed the political abuse of social media.To some participants the undertaking feels very different. Notes from the recorded conversation with a 16-year-old participant — the authenticity of which was confirmed by The Post — indicate “He said it’s really fun and he works with his friends.” The participant through family members declined to comment.The social media users active in the campaign some of whom were using their real names identified themselves only as Trump supporters and young Republicans. One described herself simply as a high school sophomore interested in softball and cheerleading.Noonan 46 said “some of the comments may go too far” but cast the activity as a response to similar exaggerations by Democrats. “Liberals say things that are way out there and conservatives say things that are sometimes way out there or don’t have enough evidence.”Those recruited to participate in the campaign were lifting the language from a shared online document according to Noonan and other people familiar with the setup. They posted the same lines a limited number of times to avoid automated detection by the technology companies these people said. They also were instructed to edit the beginning and ending of each snippet to differentiate the posts slightly according to the notes from the recorded conversation with a participant.Noonan said his daughters sometimes work from an office in the Phoenix area and are classified as independent contractors not earning “horrible money” but also not making minimum wage. Relatives of another person involved said the minor is paid an hourly rate and can score bonuses if his posts spur higher engagement.Smith as part of written responses to The Post deferred specific questions about the financial setup to a “marketing partner” called Rally Forge which he said was running the program for Turning Point.Jake Hoffman president and chief executive of the Phoenix-based digital marketing firm confirmed the online workers were classified as contractors but declined to comment further on “private employment matters.” He did not respond to a question about the office setup.Addressing the use of centralized documents to prepare the messages Hoffman said in written responses “Every working team within my agency works out of dozens of collaborative documents every day as is common with all dynamic marketing agencies or campaign phone banks for example.”The messages have appeared mainly as replies to news articles about politics and public health posted on social media. They seek to cast doubt on the integrity of the electoral process asserting that Democrats are using mail balloting to steal the election — “thwarting the will of the American people” they alleged.The posts also play down the threat from covid-19 which claimed the life of Turning Point’s co-founder Bill Montgomery in July. One post which was spread across social media dozens of times suggested baselessly that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is inflating the death toll from the disease. (Most experts say deaths are probably undercounted.) Another pushed for schools to reopen reasoning “President Trump is not worried because younger people do very well while dealing with covid.”Much of the blitz was aimed squarely at Joe Biden the Democratic presidential nominee. The former vice president asserted one message “is being controlled by behind the scenes individuals who want to take America down the dangerous path towards socialism.”By seeking to rebut mainstream news articles the operation illustrates the extent to which some online political activism is designed to discredit the media.In removing accounts Tuesday Twitter pointed to policies specifying “You can’t artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts.” That includes “coordinating with or compensating others to engage in artificial engagement or amplification even if the people involved use only one account” according to Twitter.On Twitter the nearly verbatim language emanated from about two dozen accounts through the summer. The exact number of people posting the messages was not clear. Smith the Turning Point field director said “The number fluctuates and many have gone back to school.” Hoffman in an email said “Dozens of young people have been excited to share their beliefs on social media.”The Rally Forge leader is a city council member in Queen Creek Ariz. and a candidate for the state legislature.Some of the users at points listed their location as Gilbert Ariz. a suburb of Phoenix according to screen shots reviewed by The Post. Some followed each other on Twitter while most were following only a list of prominent politicians and media outlets.One was followed by a former member of Congress Republican Tim Huelskamp of Kansas who is on the Catholics for Trump advisory board. Huelskamp said he could not recall what led him to follow the account and was not familiar with the effort by Turning Point. But he praised the group for “doing a great job of messaging particularly with younger folks.”Several teenagers were using their real names or variations of their names while other accounts active in posting the pro-Trump messaging appeared to be operating under pseudonyms. The Post’s review found that some participants seem to maintain multiple accounts on Facebook which is a violation of the company’s policies.Explaining why the users do not disclose that they are being paid as political activists Hoffman said they are “using their own personal profiles and sharing their content that reflects their values and beliefs.” He pointed to the risk of online bullying as well as physical harm in explaining why “we’ve left how much personal and professional information they wish to share up to them.”The accounts on Twitter alone posted 4401 tweets with identical content not including slight variations of the language according to Pik-Mai Hui a PhD student in informatics at Indiana University at Bloomington who performed an analysis of the content at the request of The Post. The analysis found characteristics strongly suggestive of bots — such as double commas and dangling commas that often appear with automatic scripts — though at least some of the accounts were being operated by humans.While the messaging appears designed to seed pro-Trump content across social media said Kathleen Hall Jamieson a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication the act of repeated posting also helps instill the ideas among those performing the activity. In addition it familiarizes the users with the ways of online combat she said and makes their accounts valuable assets should different needs arise as the election nears.“There is a logic to having an army locally situated in a battleground state having them up and online and ready to be deployed” Jamieson said.Turning Point Action debuted as a 501(c)(4) organization last year with more leeway in undertaking political advocacy than is afforded to the original group which is barred from campaign activity as a 501(c)(3). Both nonprofits are required only to disclose the salaries of directors officers and key employees said Marc Owens a tax attorney with Loeb & Loeb.Turning Point dates to 2012 when Montgomery retired from a career in marketing heard Kirk then 18 deliver a speech in the Chicago suburbs at Benedictine University’s “Youth Government Day.” He called the address “practically Reaganesque” according to a 2015 profile in Crain’s Chicago Business newspaper and urged Kirk a former Eagle Scout to put off college in favor of full-time political activism. Kirk became the face of Turning Point while Montgomery was “the old guy who keeps it all legal” he told the business weekly.The organization amassed prominent and wealthy conservative allies including Richard Grenell the former ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence and Foster Friess who made a fortune in mutual funds and helps bankroll conservative and Christian causes. Both men sit on Turning Point’s honorary board.Its standing rose significantly as Trump came to power. Turning Point USA brought in nearly $80000 in contributions and other funds in the fiscal year ending June 2013 according to IRS filings a fraction of the $8 million it reported for 2017 and $11 million for 2018.The group which describes itself as the “largest and fastest-growing youth organization in America” claims to have a presence on more than 2000 college and high school campuses. It hosts activist conferences and runs an alumni program. It also maintains a “Professor Watchlist” designed to expose instructors who “discriminate against conservative students promote anti-American values and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.”Kirk the group’s president and co-founder has been embraced and promoted by Trump and his family. Speaking at Turning Point USA’s Teen Student Action Summit last year Trump hailed Kirk for building a “movement unlike anything in the history of our nation.” A quote attributed to Donald Trump Jr. who has appeared at numerous Turning Point events features prominently on the group’s website: “I’m convinced that the work by Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk will win back the future of America.”Kirk has returned the praise. In his speech at last month’s Republican nominating convention he extolled Trump as the “bodyguard of Western civilization.”Equally impassioned rhetoric marked the campaign on social media with posts asserting that Black Lives Matter protesters were “fascist groups . . . terrorizing American citizens” and decrying the “BLM Marxist agenda” among other incendiary language.Noonan said his wife a hairstylist monitors the online activity of their daughters more closely than he does and that their work is often a topic of conversation when the family convenes in the evening.“We are Trump supporters but one of the things my wife and I have been very consistent on is to always understand both sides and make decisions from there” the father said.,body,https://washingtonpost.com/politics/turning-point-teens-disinformation-trump/2020/09/15/c84091ae-f20a-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html?tid=pm_pop&itid=pm_pop,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Top HHS official apologizes for incendiary remarks accusing colleagues of ‘sedition’,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/caputo-apology-hhs/2020/09/15/9cf935dc-f787-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
At his meeting with staff members Tuesday Caputo apologized for his remarks and the embarrassment they brought upon the agency according to the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the proceedings. He also indicated his departure might be imminent saying he was considering a medical leave. He added that his family had been receiving threats and that his physical health was in question.Neither Caputo nor HHS responded immediately to a request for comment about the staff meeting which was first reported by Politico.Several current and former officials said the recent controversies engulfing Caputo threatened a crucial public relations campaign to win public trust in a coronavirus vaccine that has already been highly politicized.White House officials were in discussion with HHS Secretary Alex Azar about Caputo’s future said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal private discussions.Caputo a Trump loyalist has sought to exert control over the messages coming from scientists and top health officials since the White House installed him at the agency in April. Democrats called for his resignation on Monday — and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) called for Azar’s resignation on Tuesday — after The Washington Post and others reported how Caputo and a top aide Paul Alexander attempted to interfere in the weekly scientific missives produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention known as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports.McMaster University in Ontario Canada where Alexander is listed as a part-time assistant professor also sought to distance itself from him on Monday.“While Paul Alexander graduated with a PhD in health research methodologies from McMaster in 2015 he is not currently teaching and he is not paid by the university for his contract role as a part-time assistant professor” said Susan Emigh a McMaster spokeswoman. “As a consultant he is not speaking on behalf of McMaster University or the Department of Health Research Methods Evidence and Impact.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/caputo-apology-hhs/2020/09/15/9cf935dc-f787-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Global views of U.S. plunge to new lows amid pandemic, poll finds,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/15/global-views-united-states-trump-coronavirus-pew-poll/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The data released by Pew Research Center suggests that the international reputation of the United States has dropped to a new low in the face of a disorganized response to the novel coronavirus. The country leads the world in virus-related deaths.International affairs analysts say it may be difficult to repair the damage to the United States’ standing overseas. Among some traditional allies like Germany views of the United States have declined to the lowest levels since Pew began tracking them nearly two decades ago.“I still think there is admiration for the United States but it may be waning very quickly — especially if Trump gets reelected” said Sudha David-Wilp a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.Pew surveyed 13 foreign nations all wealthy democracies along with the United States this summer.After Trump entered office in 2017 Pew found much of the world to hold a negative view of the U.S. leader with views of the United States overall dipping in many nations.But Pew’s latest polling suggests that the pandemic an unprecedented global crisis has caused views of the United States among its closest peers to slide even further.In contrast many respondents had positive perspectives on their own countries: Nearly three-quarters of people polled said their own governments had done a good job handling the crisis.Internationally the U.S. rating was significantly lower than the ratings for the World Health Organization which the Trump administration has dubbed “corrupt” and China the epicenter of the initial outbreak which Trump said “sent us the plague.”In at least seven nations including key allies like Britain and Japan approval ratings for the United States plunged to record lows. In Germany just 26 percent of the respondents held a positive view of the United States — the lowest rating since 2003 the year of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.Among the countries surveyed Belgians had the lowest estimation of the United States: Just 24 percent of Belgians said they had a positive view.Pew has only recorded lower ratings twice: Both times in Spain during the administration of President George W. Bush when 16 and 23 percent of the Spanish population had a favorable view of the United States in 2003 and 2006 respectively.This spring even before the pandemic surged in the United States David-Wilp said German experts and commentators with whom she spoke expressed doubts that the United States would be able to handle the pandemic and feared that serious social unrest would develop.“And lo and behold you did actually see that” she said referring to the high number of deaths in the United States and the protests against racial injustice that have swept the country.Trump has proved consistently unpopular in global polls but the pandemic appears to have worsened his international reputation. Positive ratings of Trump in Japan dropped from 36 percent in spring 2019 to 25 percent this year — still the highest of any nation surveyed.The decline was even more pronounced in South Korea where 46 percent of respondents gave Trump a positive rating in spring 2019 compared with 17 percent this year. South Koreans gave the U.S. handling of the pandemic the worst rating of any nation with 6 percent saying the United States did a good job.South Korea a key U.S. ally tends to see the country in a positive light said Kang Won-taek a professor at Seoul National University. Trump’s outreach to North Korea and interest in the peninsula may have given his popularity a boost among some South Koreans in recent years.“The euphoria is gone” Kang said in an email pointing to a lack of progress in peace talks with Pyongyang and Trump’s heavy-handed approach to relations with Seoul. The U.S. handling of the novel coronavirus had dented the country’s standing with South Koreans he said.“As a matter of fact many Koreans are very surprised that the U.S. has not effectively dealt with the outbreak” Kang said adding that many Koreans pin the blame on what they see as Trump’s unreliability.Other world leaders fared better than Trump on the world stage. Though China is widely criticized for aggressive foreign policy moves and its secrecy during the early days of the pandemic President Xi Jinping has a marginally more positive international reputation than Trump Pew found.Russian President Vladimir Putin widely suspected of backing attempts at electoral interference and the assassination of dissidents also fared better as did British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron.German Chancellor Angela Merkel frequently criticized by Trump in recent years was by far the most popular leader among those surveyed with a median of 76 percent expressing confidence that she will do the right thing in global affairs.The contrast between Merkel’s cautious handling of Germany’s federal system during the pandemic and Trump’s less disciplined approach David-Wilp said heightened many Germans’ awareness of her reputation.“Germans I think have been surprised and maybe secretly proud of Chancellor Merkel” David-Wilp said. “I think she really touched a nerve with the German people in the sense that she was very open and direct and called [the pandemic] what it was: The biggest crisis Germany is facing in the post-war era.”Pew said it gathered its survey data using nationally representative surveys of 13273 adults from June 10 through Aug. 3 with all interviews conducted by phone. The margin of error ranged from 3.1 percentage points in South Korea to 4.2 in Belgium.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/15/global-views-united-states-trump-coronavirus-pew-poll/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Scientific American backs Biden for its first presidential endorsement in 175 years,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/09/15/scientific-american-joe-biden/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
It was a striking move for the oldest continuously published magazine in the United States and one its editor in chief Laura Helmuth said was both carefully considered and entirely necessary. (Helmuth previously worked as The Washington Post’s science editor.)Four years ago the magazine flagged Donald Trump’s disdain for science as “frightening” but did not go so far as to endorse his rival Hillary Clinton. This year its editors came to a different conclusion.“A 175-year tradition is not something you break lightly” Helmuth told The Post on Tuesday. “We’d love to stay out of politics but this president has been so anti-science that we can’t ignore it.”The endorsement is one of several occasions during the president’s tenure when the scientific community has denounced President Trump’s beliefs and policies. The 2017 March for Science rallied the community to defend its institutions from budget cuts and undermining by Trump and his appointees. A growing movement to get scientists to run for political office emerged ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Most recently in May the medical journal the Lancet blasted Trump in an editorial for his “inconsistent and incoherent” coronavirus response.Scientific American’s 1400-word editorial is as much an endorsement of Biden as it is a catalogue of Trump’s hostility to science throughout his term.In a nod to Trump’s embrace of anti-science conspiracy theories Scientific American editors compared the people each candidate turns to for expertise and insight. Biden’s panel of public health advisers include figures such as former U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief David Kessler and immunologist Rebecca Katz.Ultimately it was Trump’s response to the novel coronavirus that created a new sense of urgency for Scientific American’s editors Helmuth said.“We’ve seen the consequences of this so tragically with the coronavirus pandemic. It will be 200000 people who have died from the virus and a lot of that is on his hands” Helmuth said of Trump.In a statement Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh defended the president’s handling of the pandemic writing “President Trump has listened to the medical experts every step of the way to fight the coronavirus and the experts agree that the restriction on travel from China saved thousands of American lives."Despite the excoriation of the president for his anti-science stance Helmuth stressed that the editors wanted their endorsement to be fact-based and evidence-backed — not partisan.“We never used the world ‘Republican’ or ‘Democrat’; it’s strictly about these two people” Helmuth said.In such a politically fractured environment Helmuth acknowledged that editors were concerned how an endorsement might read and if it would undermine the public’s faith in scientific institutions like theirs.Scientific American’s track record of not endorsing candidates is what could ultimately give its endorsement more weight according to Paul Beck a political scientist and professor emeritus at Ohio State University.“An endorsement from an organization like that — that has been in the past above politics — would carry considerable weight with their audience” Beck told The Post calling the Scientific American endorsement “powerful.”For an organization that has avoided political endorsements for so long to join the fray is unusual Beck said — though when it comes to the 2020 race he said nothing surprises him.“You have a truly anti-science president” Beck said “and the scientific community by and large has been appalled at what has come out of the president’s mouth and come out of Washington.”The fractured news environments and hyper-partisanship of American politics have diminished the power of political endorsements compared with election cycles past Beck said. Endorsements could still have an effect on undecided voters whom he estimated at a small percentage of the electorate in the realm of 10 percent or less.When it comes to potential Trump voters an endorsement from a respected outlet like Scientific American won’t move the die-hard supporters he said but it might sway Republicans or independents who already have doubts.“You can imagine if I’m a subscriber to Scientific American and a Republican I might say ‘Well see maybe I shouldn’t vote Republican this time around’ ” Beck said.Helmuth said that after careful consideration of what an endorsement would mean the decision by Scientific American’s editorial board was ultimately unanimous.“We cover the intersection of scientific issues that have political relevance” she said “but this is the first time we’ve said ‘If you care about science and you’re a voter there’s an obvious choice.’ ”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/09/15/scientific-american-joe-biden/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Trump’s China tariffs violate global trade rules, WTO says,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/wto-trump-china-trade/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
A three-member WTO panel struck at the core of Trump’s trade war on China ruling that the tariffs he imposed more than two years ago on $234 billion worth of Chinese goods ran afoul of U.S. commitments under global trading rules.The ruling will have no immediate impact on U.S. customs officials’ ability to collect the levies from American importers but it represents a diplomatic dent in the president’s trade offensive.Several hours later the administration said it was abandoning a tariff on aluminum from Canada that the president had imposed just last month settling instead for making public its expectation that imports will decline. The move came hours before Chrystia Freeland Canada’s deputy prime minister who had vowed a “dollar for dollar” response was expected to announce retaliatory tariffs on American products.“Both actions reflect the iron law of trade retaliation. When the U.S. imposes import taxes on foreign goods other countries will hit back” said John Veroneau a partner at Covington & Burling and a former U.S. trade negotiator in the administration of President George W. Bush.That view has not always been accepted by senior Trump administration figures. In 2018 Peter Navarro one of the president’s closest trade advisers insisted that U.S. trading partners would not respond if the president made their products more expensive for American buyers.“I don’t believe any country is going to retaliate for the simple reason that we are the most lucrative and biggest market in the world” Navarro told Fox Business. “They know they’re cheating us and all we’re doing is standing up for ourselves.”The administration had argued before the WTO that its tariffs were needed to curb years of trade cheating by China. But in a 66-page report the panel rejected that claim.“The United States has not met its burden of demonstrating that the measures” are justified the panel concluded.Robert E. Lighthizer the U.S. trade representative issued a statement criticizing the decision saying it showed that the WTO was unable to prevent Chinese policies from distorting global trade and harming the U.S. economy. The president imposed the tariffs on Chinese goods following an investigation by Lighthizer’s office that concluded China routinely engaged in unfair trade practices including compelling foreign firms to transfer technology secrets and violating intellectual property safeguards.“Although the panel did not dispute the extensive evidence submitted by the United States of intellectual property theft by China its decision shows that the WTO provides no remedy for such misconduct. The United States must be allowed to defend itself against unfair trade practices and the Trump Administration will not let China use the WTO to take advantage of American workers businesses farmers and ranchers” Lighthizer said.In a separate announcement Lighthizer said the administration was dropping a 10 percent tariff on Canadian aluminum which took effect Aug. 16.The U.S. move followed consultations with the Canadian government and came as Canadian officials were preparing to unveil retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Lighthizer said the United States had scrapped its tariff plans based on “expectations” that Canadian shipments of the industrial metal would decline by 50 percent from levels during the first half of this year and he released specific permissible monthly totals for imports in each of the next four months.The United States reserves the right to reimpose the import levies if imports exceed 105 percent of those levels though Lighthizer’s statement effectively postpones any resumption of the tariff fight until after the election.Freeland bluntly described the U.S. decision as a “unilateral” one and reiterated that Canada would strike back against any future threats.“This is not a negotiated deal between Canada and the United States” she told reporters. “We have not agreed to anything. We have not negotiated an agreement with the United States on quotas.”The United States first imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum in 2018 citing the threat to national security from a reliance upon foreign suppliers. The president exempted Canada and Mexico from the levies the following year when a new North American trade pact was completed.When Trump announced last month that he was reimposing the aluminum tariffs citing an import surge Canadian officials said they would retaliate against $3.6 billion in U.S. goods including bicycles washing machines and refrigerators.The items were “explicitly targeted at products that were politically sensitive” and made in swing-state factories according to Eric Miller president of Rideau Potomac Strategy Group a trade consultancy.The on-again off-again nature of the president’s tariffs has confounded American businesses leaving many uncertain of their raw material costs from one month to the next. The Aluminum Association an industry group endorsed the decision to drop the tariffs which it called “disruptive and unnecessary.”The U.S. Chamber of Commerce which often has been critical of the administration’s tariff diplomacy also welcomed the move.“What American manufacturers need now is certainty that these tariffs won’t make another reappearance. Setting aside these threats once and for all will allow American job creators to focus on economic recovery” said Myron Brilliant executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber.In the case of the China tariffs the WTO ruling could eventually authorize China to impose higher tariffs on a range of U.S. products. But the United States can effectively stall any further action by appealing Tuesday’s ruling. The administration has blocked for months the appointment of new members to the WTO’s appellate body leaving the organization unable to fulfill its assigned role of adjudicating trade spats. The panel acknowledged its ruling comes amid “unprecedented global trade tensions.”Wendy Cutler vice president of the Asia Society said the verdict illustrated the weakness of the global trading regime established in 1995 with U.S. support.“In another era this ruling would have been the talk of the town in the trade community. But the finding comes as no surprise and without a fully operating appellate body it won’t have a consequential impact” said Cutler a former trade negotiator.China petitioned the WTO within weeks of the first U.S. tariffs arguing that the Trump administration had breached global trade rules by unilaterally imposing the import levies.The two countries subsequently negotiated a partial trade deal which was unveiled at a White House ceremony in January. The “phase one” deal called for China to buy an additional $200 billion from U.S. suppliers but left many of the administration’s broader complaints about Chinese state subsidies and trade practices for future negotiations.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/wto-trump-china-trade/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Opinion | Nobody wants vaccine trials to fail. But they just might.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/nobody-wants-vaccine-trials-fail-they-just-might/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
But if that assumption proves faulty (and here’s hoping it doesn’t) all bets are off. There would then simply be no way to estimate when a successful trial might be completed and a vaccine available.Make no mistake we desperately need a vaccine to help end this pandemic. And we are all rooting for the success of these vaccine candidates. But the recent experience of the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has shown that things can go awry quickly. The company announced last week that it was placing its Phase 3 vaccine trial on hold after a patient possibly developed a serious vaccine complication called transverse myelitis. AstraZeneca has since announced that it will partially resume its trial without providing much detail; nevertheless the episode is a reminder that Phase 3 trials are not some regulatory hurdle erected by obstinate “deep state” bureaucrats. They are in fact essential to assessing a product’s safety and effectiveness — and have for almost 60 years.Like many other medical products vaccines are tested in three phrases starting with a Phase 1 study involving 20 to 80 healthy subjects that assesses how the body metabolizes the vaccine and ensures it is not extremely toxic. If that test is successful the sponsor may move on to Phase 2 typically a non-randomized study (or studies) that begins to explore the effectiveness of the product over a range of doses and also assesses short-term side effects. A Phase 3 study may begin after that typically a randomized controlled trial which in the case of covid-19 vaccines will involve about 30000 patients and determine definitively whether the vaccine is safe and effective enough for widespread use.Nine vaccines are in Phase 3 and dozens are in some phase of human testing but what is the likelihood that they will work? Perhaps not as high as some might think.In the waning days of the previous administration a team I led at the Food and Drug Administration released a report including 22 detailed case studies of products in which promising Phase 2 results were not confirmed by subsequent Phase 3 testing. We intended these cases to be illustrative not exhaustive. We relied only on publicly available information and included only the most clear-cut cases though many more could have been included.In these 22 case studies 14 featured Phase 3 studies that failed to confirm product effectiveness hinted at in Phase 2 one identified a safety issue and seven could not confirm either safety or effectiveness. Phase 3 studies for two products actually demonstrated that they caused a higher rate of the condition they were designed to prevent.Five of these 22 were for vaccines; four failed to demonstrate efficacy in their Phase 3 trials while the fifth failed to prove either safety or efficacy.Of course each disease and each vaccine is unique. The case study most relevant to our current predicament was a vaccine for the sexually transmitted disease herpes type 2. Two Phase 2 studies for this vaccine showed that patients developed antibody responses similar to those in patients who acquired herpes naturally — much like the antibody responses recently demonstrated in Phase 1 and 2 studies of several candidate covid-19 vaccines. But in two Phase 3 trials for the herpes vaccine involving almost 2400 patients the vaccinated groups acquired herpes at the same rate as the placebo groups and the product was abandoned.To estimate the likelihood of product success researchers have used industry data to track compounds that entered into human testing in the past several decades. Such studies typically estimate that only 10 to 14 percent of such compounds are ultimately approved. Those that make it to Phase 3 have an approximately 50 percent chance of being approved.The public discourse seems to assume that all or most of the covid-19 products undergoing Phase 3 testing will work. But if past is prologue there is a chance that some or maybe even all will not prove effective and safe.In the midst of a pandemic it remains appropriate to prepare for the possibility that a vaccine will succeed by preparing plans to administer the product and ramping up production as the administration has done. But what we shouldn’t be doing is ramping up public expectation that an effective vaccine is imminent.We will soon learn the outcome of these trials. In the meantime let’s prepare members of the public for the possibility that they may have to continue the social distancing and mask-wearing that when rigorously practiced have been so effective in this pandemic.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/nobody-wants-vaccine-trials-fail-they-just-might/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Trump seizes on judge’s ruling that Pennsylvania lockdown is ‘unconstitutional’,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/14/pennsylvania-ruling-trump/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The case stemmed from a complaint filed in May by four Pennsylvania counties — Butler Fayette Greene and Washington — that argued against the state’s orders to close “non-life-sustaining” businesses and limit gatherings to 25 people indoors or 250 people outdoors.Stickman opined “open-ended” measures imposed on people are an overreaching violation of constitutional rights.“The court believes that defendants undertook their actions in a well-intentioned effort to protect Pennsylvanians from the virus” the ruling said. “However good intentions toward a laudable end are not alone enough to uphold governmental action against a constitutional challenge.”Within hours after the decision was filed Trump retweeted nearly two dozen posts about the blow to the Democratic governor’s oversight of his state. In one post seniors wag their fingers and peel off their face coverings to the beat of Twisted Sister’s “We’re Not Gonna Take It.”“PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR TOM WOLF AN YOUR STUPID WIFE .....YOUR NOT GOING TO MURDER US !!! TRUMP 2020 … WE LOVE PENNSYLVANIA” the caption read.At a “Latinos for Trump” roundtable Monday night the president claimed without evidence states will open everything Nov. 4 and said he hopes other judges will strike down coronavirus mandates.“We hope that’s going to happen in North Carolina” he said. “We hope it’s going to happen in Michigan too because it’s just totally shut down.”Trump has repeatedly criticized Democratic governors for shutting down their states’ economies in efforts to curb the spread of the virus.Wolf will seek a stay of the decision and file an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit his spokesperson Lyndsay Kensinger wrote in a statement to The Post.“The actions taken by the administration were mirrored by governors across the country and saved and continue to save lives in the absence of federal action” Kensinger wrote. “This decision is especially worrying as Pennsylvania and the rest of the country are likely to face a challenging time with the possible resurgence of covid-19 and the flu in the fall and winter.”Kensinger said the ruling would not affect current restrictions with many already lifted as the state has partially reopened.The judicial decision comes as new infections reported in Pennsylvania have leveled. The state’s seven-day average for daily cases was 743. Pennsylvania has totaled 145063 reported infections since the start of the pandemic.The state has among the lowest infections per capita in the nation.The majority of Pennsylvania voters surveyed 62 percent said the governor has done a good job handling the pandemic according to a Monmouth University poll in August. In contrast 53 percent of the voters disapproved of how Trump has responded to the crisis.White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx praised Wolf in a Sept. 3 press briefing in Harrisburg saying his state was making “great progress.”Conservatives have challenged Democratic state leaders’ handling of the pandemic bringing legal cases against restrictions that limit individual freedoms.In Michigan the state’s appeals court ruled in August for Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer denying Republican lawmakers’ challenge of her emergency declarations.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/14/pennsylvania-ruling-trump/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Analysis | Trump confirms he wanted to assassinate Assad. In 2018, he denied it was even considered.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/15/trump-confirms-he-wanted-assassinate-assad-2018-he-denied-it-was-even-considered/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
In the Fox interview Trump criticized former defense secretary Jim Mattis who has in recent months warned the country strongly against reelecting Trump. But in the course of making that case Trump offered an odd claim: He said Mattis had effectively stood in the way of his efforts to assassinate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.“I would’ve rather taken him out” Trump said. “I had him all set. Mattis didn’t want to do it. Mattis was a highly overrated general.”When asked whether he regretted not taking Assad out Trump added: “No I don’t regret that. … I had a shot to take him out if I wanted. Mattis was against it.”The first problem with this argument is that Trump is disparaging Mattis for opposing something that Trump doesn’t even say he regrets. The second is that the commander in chief makes these decisions full stop. If Trump wanted to do it Mattis couldn’t block him. The fact that Mattis expressed opposition to a plan that Trump even today doesn’t necessarily advocate may not be the best example of him being a bad public servant.But perhaps the biggest problem is that in the course of making this strange argument Trump directly contradicted himself. The contradiction dates back as it happens to the last time Woodward published a book about him.In 2018 Woodward published “Fear.” In the book he reported Trump had considered assassinating Assad.After Assad launched a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017 Trump called Mattis and said he wanted to assassinate the dictator. “Let’s fucking kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the fucking lot of them” Trump said according to Woodward.“I heard somewhere where they said the assassination of President Assad by the United States. Never even discussed” Trump said adding: “No that was never even contemplated nor would it be contemplated.”He even held it up as evidence that the book shouldn’t have been published.“It should not have been written about in the book” Trump said. “It’s just more fiction. The book is total fiction. Okay?”Trump is now confirming what he claimed was “fiction” was actually very accurate. But as is often the case with Trump it’s still not clear what is the truth.Trump in 2018 after all wasn’t the only one offering something amounting to a denial. So too did then-United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.“I have the pleasure of being privy to those conversations … and I have not once heard the president talk about assassinating Assad” Haley said at the time.It’s theoretically possible such discussions occurred after the September 2018 denials but Mattis resigned in December of that year. In the intervening three months there were no new chemical weapons attacks by the Assad government. Trump was also moving to withdraw from Syria at this time — a decision that led to Mattis’s resignation.The White House had good reason to deny such plans in 2018. Even planning such an operation as a contingency would be highly questionable given its impact in a volatile region — a fact that reinforces the dicey nature of what Trump decided to confirm Tuesday morning. But after all that went into Trump’s denial we just needed Woodward to publish another book for Trump to give an entirely different version of events.It sure undermines Trump’s efforts to cast Woodward as the one who can’t be trusted.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/15/trump-confirms-he-wanted-assassinate-assad-2018-he-denied-it-was-even-considered/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Navalny shares photo from hospital, intends to return to Russia once recovered,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/navalny-shares-photo-from-hospital-intends-to-return-to-russia-once-recovered/2020/09/15/26c48c0a-f740-11ea-85f7-5941188a98cd_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Navalny 44 became ill during an Aug. 20 flight to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tomsk. By the time the plane made an emergency landing in nearby Omsk Navalny was unconscious. Yarmysh said she suspected he was poisoned when he drank a cup of tea at the airport that morning.Doctors in Omsk said they found no traces of poison when treating Navalny for two days but the Berlin hospital attributed his condition to poison similar to the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok the same substance that Britain said Russian state security agents used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury England in 2018. On Monday Germany said French and Swedish labs had confirmed its findings.Charité hospital said Navalny regained consciousness last week after more than two weeks in a medically induced coma and he was able to get out of bed for short periods on Monday. In his Instagram post Tuesday morning Navalny is shown sitting up in bed beside his wife and two children and without breathing aids. “Hello it’s Navalny” the post says. “I miss you.”“I still can’t do much but yesterday I was able to breathe on my own all day long” it continues. “I did not use any outside help not even the simplest valve in my throat. I liked it very much. An amazing underestimated by many process. I recommend it.”Navalny’s allies have blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government for Navalny’s poisoning and an eventual return to Russia could be dangerous. Navalny who was barred from running for president in 2018 has frequently been jailed and harassed. And this was not the first time he has been the victim of a toxic attack. In 2017 Navalny was attacked with an antiseptic green dye that damaged vision in one of his eyes.Navalny’s team has published investigations exposing graft and wrongdoing by Russia’s elite. Over the past year he has encouraged voters to back anti-Kremlin candidates as a message of discontent over Russia’s sagging economy and the unchecked power of Putin who has the potential to stay in office until 2036 under constitutional changes approved this year.Navalny-backed candidates won seats in regional elections over the weekend on city councils in Tomsk and Novosibirsk the two cities Navalny visited on the trip just before he was poisoned. Putin’s United Russia party lost council majorities in both places.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asked Tuesday about Navalny’s intention to return to the country said “any citizen of the Russian Federation can leave Russia and return to Russia of his own volition.”“If the health of this citizen of the Russian Federation improves of course this will make everyone glad” Peskov said.Despite calls from the West to investigate how Navalny was poisoned Moscow has not opened a criminal case and has denied any official involvement. A Kremlin summary of a phone conversation Monday between Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron said: “The parties discussed in detail the situation surrounding the Alexei Navalny case. Putin in turn reiterated that the unsubstantiated and groundless accusations made against Russia in this context are inappropriate.”Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian state television Monday that “Western partners are glancing at us with arrogance [as if they] have a right to doubt our correctness and professionalism.”Sergei Naryshkin director of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service even hinted Tuesday that Germany could be responsible for Navalny’s poisoning. “It is a fact that the moment Alexei Navalny left the Russian territory there were no toxins in his system” he told reporters in Moscow. “Therefore we have many questions for the German side.”Germany’s justice ministry said last week it had consented to a request from Moscow for “mutual legal assistance” in Navalny’s case and had tasked Berlin state authorities with handling it.Berlin state prosecutors confirmed that they had been asked to respond to the request and provide information on Navalny’s health subject to his consent. State prosecutors have yet to meet with Navalny according to a Berlin justice department spokesman. If Navalny consents spokesman Sebastian Brux said information on his medical condition will be passed on.Loveday Morris in Berlin contributed to this report.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/navalny-shares-photo-from-hospital-intends-to-return-to-russia-once-recovered/2020/09/15/26c48c0a-f740-11ea-85f7-5941188a98cd_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Peace deal or arms race? Proposed sale of F-35 jets to UAE prompts fears in Israel.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-uae-jets-peace/2020/09/14/ae0950a6-f682-11ea-85f7-5941188a98cd_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Senior U.S. and UAE officials say the peace agreement is smoothing the way for the Trump administration to proceed with the sale of long-sought F-35 stealth fighter jets and other sophisticated weaponry to the Persian Gulf state. That prospect is increasing the likelihood that Israel and other Middle East countries will in turn seek more advanced arms.In Israel the proposed sale is tainting the otherwise great enthusiasm here for the agreements brokered by the White House to normalize relations with the UAE and Bahrain as well.“From a purely military perspective I think it’s a dangerous development. It’s not just a new weapons technology. The F-35 is an entire weapons platform” said Chuck Freilich a former deputy national security adviser in Israel and an analyst of U.S.-Israel relations. He said the F-35s would represent a “dramatic upgrading” of the UAE’s military capability.Eli Cohen Israel’s intelligence minister said in an interview that the historic peace agreements to be signed Tuesday will buttress Israel’s security by strengthening the alliance against Iran which he called the main threat to Middle East stability. At the same time he said Israel — which already has a fleet of 20 F-35s — would object to any arms deal that erodes its military superiority in the region.“We have a clear policy about maintaining our advantage and will protest any weaponry that might damage that advantage” he said.U.S. and UAE officials have not disclosed details of the proposed sale including the number of jets and how advanced a model. But under a 12-year-old law the United States is committed to ensuring that Israel maintains a “qualitative military edge.”The UAE’s minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash told journalists Tuesday that the peace agreement with Israel should remove any “grain of doubt” about whether Israel’s security could be endangered by the UAE’s long-standing request to modernize its air force with F-35s.A senior figure in ­Israel’s defense establishment however warned that there was no guarantee relations between Israel and the UAE would remain amicable.“Things change here rapidly and we always need to be aware of this” said the senior figure who spoke on the condition of anonymity to address security discussions. “Israel is a small country. Its military advantage allows it to maintain strategic virtual depth. Removing this edge is extremely worrying for Israel’s security.”The Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom considered close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reported Sunday that the Israeli army is preparing to present the United States with a shopping list of advanced military hardware that would ensure Israel keeps its military edge. The newspaper said this list being compiled by a special committee set up by Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz would probably include advanced munitions and expedited delivery of V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft combat planes and other weapons. The Israeli military would not confirm the accuracy of this report.According to media reports in Israel and the United States ­Netanyahu privately condoned the proposed sale of the fighter jets to the UAE as part of an overall deal that included normalizing relations between the UAE and Israel.But Netanyahu who arrived in Washington on Monday ahead of the White House ceremony has repeatedly denied agreeing to such an arrangement. A recent statement from his office said the prime minister had made clear his opposition during a July conversation with U.S. Ambassador David Friedman to the sale of F-35s and other advanced weaponry to another Middle East country.As with an earlier sale of F-16s to Egypt the United States may intend to provide the UAE with an F-35 variant that would allow Israel to maintain its advantage. It is unclear whether the UAE which already fields a powerful air force would settle for less than the most sophisticated version of the F-35.The senior Israeli defense figure said the sale of fighter jets to the UAE is sure to spark a regional arms race. “It will have a cascade effect and it will be harder to prevent sales of advanced weaponry to other countries in the region.”Qatar’s foreign minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani shared concerns over arms sales to the Middle East during an interview Sunday in Washington where he participated in security talks Monday with U.S. officials.“We don’t want to see any escalation in the region and we’ve seen that the region needs to be more peaceful more focusing on prosperity and development rather than buying military equipment” he said. “We hope that anything under consideration is just to defend our countries and not to be aggressive to other countries.” Relations between Qatar and the UAE have been extremely tense in recent years.The F-35 is produced by a U.S.-led consortium including seven American allies and six other allied countries have received the aircraft or are negotiating contracts to get them. The UAE would be the first Arab country to receive the jets.In 2008 the United States enshrined into law its commitment to ensure that Israel maintains its “qualitative military edge” in the Middle East and that pledge has earned broad bipartisan support. Over the years the United States has provided significant military assistance to back up this promise with the Obama administration allocating $38 billion in a 10-year aid package.Israeli concerns over the F-35 sale to the UAE could now find sympathetic members in Congress.“Depending on what [the Emirates] want exactly it could potentially cause a lot of heartburn on both sides of the aisle” said a congressional aide who deals regularly with arms transfers. “This is an increasing curiosity for us because there’s been no information coming” from the administration.“For some it might be okay” said the aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “But this is a game changer giving the Emiratis these kind of capabilities for really an unknown purpose. In which conflict do they need an F-35?”A previous sale of U.S. weapons to the UAE was included in an $8 billion package advanced by the Trump administration last year. By declaring an “emergency” ostensibly a threat posed by Iran the White House was able to circumvent congressional oversight of the deal. President Trump also vetoed a bipartisan resolution that would have blocked U.S. sales to both Saudi Arabia and the UAE for use in Yemen.A similar emergency declaration to advance the F-35 sale could be hard to defend. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described the emergency declaration last year as a “one-time event.”But Aaron David Miller a former U.S. peace negotiator for the Middle East said it would be difficult for lawmakers to derail the F-35 deal even if they wanted to. “It’s very hard for Congress to take responsibility for blocking something that appears tethered to [a peace agreement] that promotes American national interest.”At home Netanyahu has been criticized for not informing senior members of his government about what exactly the agreements entail.“No one knows what is in these agreements but it is certainly not peace for peace” said Nitzan Horowitz head of the left-wing Meretz party and a member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in Israel’s parliament the Knesset.Horowitz a leading advocate for peace with the Palestinians said that there has been no discussion about the agreements inside the government or in the Knesset and that Netanyahu has not even consulted with his chief of staff defense minister or foreign minister. “This has never happened before. Netanyahu just bypassed all of them” Horowitz said.Beyond the F-35s he said he was deeply concerned about the potential sale of advanced cyber systems to the UAE. “This is technology that can easily be passed on or fall into the wrong hands” he said.DeYoung reported from Washington.

Air Force seeks a radical shift in how jets, missiles and satellites are designed,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/air-force-digital-design/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Now Roper wants to make this sort of process a requirement for companies building any of the Air Force’s premier systems in the future. He is hoping to usher in a new era of weapons development in which computer-generated models — owned by the government and enabled by artificial intelligence technology — can test millions of possible designs in a virtual format before ever creating a prototype.In this case the outcome that seemed to impress him the most was the plane’s low price. Boeing’s Arlington-based defense division is known in the aerospace world for underbidding its rivals.“For me the Sputnik moment was looking under the hood at T-7” Roper said. “The airplane came in at a much lower cost than we expected which begs the question: How? That took me on the odyssey of how it was designed and assembled.”What surprised Roper about the design process for the T-7 was the use of what’s known as “digital threading” in which designers created a digital twin for the jet before manufacturing it. Starting in a virtual format means they can modify and test the plane’s systems with various configurations over the course of its design.For Boeing seeing a top Air Force official hold up the T-7 as a model for aircraft design should come as a welcome reprieve at a difficult time. The company’s reputation for sound engineering has been called into question over design flaws in the 737 Max commercial jetliner which went undiscovered until a pair of plane crashes killed 346 people. Boeing’s defense and space division despite problems with the KC-46 tanker and the Starliner capsule has been more stable by comparison.Roper recognized that a mostly digital design process represented a significant departure from the traditional way of doing things.“There is an old adage in defense acquisition called ‘fly before you buy.’ It’s a caution that you ought to build something and test it out before you commit to buying it” Roper said. “Today you can digitally buy and fly before you even commit to buying that first prototype. Let’s do that in the military and then we can design things more frequently.​​”Using a digital thread in the design process allows automated checks to happen in the background as the product is modified essentially ensuring that as different parts of a plane or missile system are designed they all fit together and don’t face integration problems.Roper said that in the past with the manual design of aircraft small differences in parts that don’t fit together well can end up becoming big problems ― like when you are trying to put together a piece of furniture from Ikea and for some reason the holes don’t line up. Even a variance of a thousandth of an inch within a complicated system can create expensive headaches.Mechanics can also learn how to assemble the plane digitally. For the Red Hawk Roper said mechanics were trained in a simulator to build the aircraft before it was ever put together in the real world.“They achieved the same quality on their first airplane that would normally be achieved on the hundredth” Roper said because they came with the experience of having built the plane digitally.Because of the approach Roper said the Air Force has been able to complete assembly and subsequent maintenance of the T-7 in record time which he described as “off the charts not near any other airplane in recorded history.”It remains to be seen whether the T-7 will live up to expectations. It’s possible the low price and faster assembly process could entail trade-offs in other areas.The U.S. Space Force which was created out of the Air Force last year also will apply this method to new system designs including the missile system that will replace the Minuteman III ICBM fleet. Roper said Northrop Grumman created a digital twin and tried out over 6 billion different variants of the new ICBM using artificial intelligence and machine learning to weigh the trade-offs between cost and different possible characteristics.It is also employing it to design a futuristic fighter jet meant to follow current aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter under a program called Next Generation Air Dominance or NGAD. That program has progressed to the point where a physical prototype ― already designed assembled and tested in a virtual system ― has been flown Roper said Tuesday.If this approach is expected to become the norm it will require a significant shift for U.S. weapons makers. An Air Force spokeswoman said the department does not yet have a written policy requiring digital design processes but is working on one. Roper says he considers the new approach to be a mandate for which any exception requires his personal sign-off.This kind of process shift ― particularly the related requirement that the digital technology be fully owned by the government ― could be controversial for large defense companies that prefer to own and profit from the intellectual property underlying their products.Hawk Carlisle a retired Air Force general who now leads the National Defense Industrial Association said a range of proprietary digital engineering efforts are already underway. He added that the defense industry on the whole would do well to transform its development process accordingly. With digital engineering “you can produce an airplane that is much faster has fewer challenges in the manufacturing process and is much more accurate and perfect. This is the way we have to go and it’s about getting speed and capability out to the warfighter quickly” he said.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/air-force-digital-design/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
At hearing on paying college athletes, Republicans say Congress should stay out of it,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/ncaa-senate-hearing-compensation/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said compensating college athletes would be a “huge mistake” and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said “it’s a terrible rotten no good idea to federalize college sports.”“The worst thing would be for the Congress itself to write the rules” said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) chair of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee which held the hearing. “If anybody has watched 15 or 20 senators try to agree on a press release imagine what 535 members of Congress would be like trying to write detailed rules.”While the NCAA has conceded that some consideration for use of athletes’ names images and likenesses is inevitable some lawmakers still have reservations about athletes pocketing any money. Alexander for instance said sponsorship money athletes receive should be redistributed to benefit their schools’ teams and athletes.“It would avoid the awkwardness of a center who earns nothing snapping the ball to a quarterback who earns a half-million dollars for promoting the local auto dealer” he said. “… If you want to keep the money and be someone‘s employee then go join a professional team.”Other lawmakers broached the possibility of an independent third party or the Federal Trade Commission providing oversight. They also explored what limits and guardrails should be in place. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) floated the possibility of capping endorsement money at $50000.But the hearing the third time in recent months Congress has taken up the issue largely made clear how much opposition remains particularly among some Republicans to the idea of federal regulation.“Be careful what you wish for” Paul said. “The history of government regulation is not a benign one.”Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) has said a power imbalance and racial inequities are built into the current system which he said relies on what amounts to an unpaid labor force. Schools reap huge revenue and then spend lavishly giving athletes educational opportunities but no money.“For all those in this body who believe in a free market I don’t know why we decide to keep it from athletes who are producing an incredibly and increasingly valuable service” he said during the hearing.Responding to a question from Murphy Rebecca Blank the chancellor at Wisconsin noted that she supports restrictions on coaches’ compensation but said the market keeps driving those salaries up.“You are not allowed by antitrust rules to restrict the pay of college coaches but you are allowed by current rules to restrict the compensation of athletes” Murphy responded. “That is just patently absurd to me.”Karen Dennis who coaches the track and field and cross-country teams at Ohio State also testified warning that smaller programs could be endangered if money is shared with athletes.“It would have a really devastating effect on how programs would be able to exist” she said noting that Minnesota cut its men’s track programs just last week.But Ramogi Huma executive director of the National College Players Association which has worked with state legislatures to craft bills related to name image and likeness issues pointed out that Ohio State saw more than $209 million in athletics-related revenue last year.“They can’t say that if they were to share some of that with some of the nonrevenue athletes that they suddenly have to cut all sports” he said. “You’ll get the scare tactic even from the top producers. It’s just not true.”During the hearing Alexander who is not seeking reelection noted that the Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over the issue but said the NCAA is best equipped to tackle it. “The alternatives are much worse” Alexander said.“The NCAA has absolutely failed in these areas when it comes to college athletes’ rights” he said. “That’s why we’re here.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/ncaa-senate-hearing-compensation/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Who needs another Zoom call? Why sending letters might help your loved ones.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/letters-pandemic-depression-anxiety-help/2020/09/14/47b3bb3a-f3b1-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Supporting friends and family who are going through a hard time used to involve meaningful chats at the local coffee shop venting over a glass of wine on the couch or warm embraces followed by words of encouragement. Now because of the coronavirus pandemic those traditions are on hold. But we can take another approach: sending handwritten letters. The old-fashioned gesture could be particularly beneficial now: The pandemic is adversely affecting Americans’ mental health and research suggests that being contacted by letter can lower the risk of suicide. Besides after months of remote work and virtual communication many people might welcome a tangible alternative to yet another Zoom call. Feel awkward writing a nondigital missive? No worries we have you covered. If you know someone who is troubled that person is not alone. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there has been a stark increase in emotional distress among Americans since the pandemic began. In June nearly 31 percent of U.S. adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression while almost 11 percent said that they had seriously considered suicide. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms alone was about triple that of the same time period in 2019. One contributing factor to the national mental health struggle during the pandemic has been the ongoing social isolation plaguing millions of Americans. It’s the greatest concern of Amanda Spray clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. “Social isolation is a symptom of depression” she says “and it leads to worsening of depression.” “[Letters] help provide social support even if you can’t be there with your friend or family member holding their hand and being by their side” says Spray who is also the director of the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Center at NYU Langone Health. Research indicates that such support can have a significant impact on recipients’ mental health. One study conducted at Stanford University in the early 1970s followed more than 800 people after they had been discharged from the hospital for depression or suicidal tendencies. One group of patients received handwritten letters from a health-care provider they knew in the five years following discharge while the other group received no letters. Patients in the letter-receiving group had lower rates of suicide over the five-year period. A more recent study looked at a new treatment for those who recently attempted suicide. The treatment involved three therapy sessions followed by two years of receiving personalized letters. There was an approximately 80 percent reduced risk of a repeat suicide attempt in the group who received letters. [‘You can do this!’ Breast cancer support campaign shows power of handwritten letters] Psychiatrist Jena Lee medical director of pediatric emergency psychiatry at UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital says that when patients are at a crisis point — meaning they’ve attempted suicide or are seriously considering it — they often can’t name one person they trust or who they know cares about them. Letters can counter that feeling. “If I had a superpower and could change one thing for everyone that would make the biggest impact for all mental illness it would be that everyone had one person who cares for them” Lee says. The medium is as important as the message. People consider letters meaningful because so much effort goes into sending them. It takes time to find the right stationery think about what to write buy postage stamps look up the person’s address and find a postbox. “It requires a kind of deliberation that is so lacking in our time of fast-paced messaging and media” Lee says. “When you receive a handwritten letter you reflexively start imagining the author sitting down and reflecting thinking about you. . . . That’s why it’s so very effective at showing someone does care about you.” [With 1920 postmark mail is delivered to Michigan home 100 years late] Early in the pandemic Good Juju Ink a stationery brand headquartered in San Francisco launched 18 Million Thanks an initiative designed to support front-line workers through handwritten cards. Ryan Kissick head of operations for Good Juju Ink says one registered nurse in Alaska got in touch with them after receiving a letter. “She said ‘This is not a fun time to be a nurse. I got a thank-you note from a patient’s spouse and I sobbed. It does matter. We are making a difference. We are all in this together’ ” Kissick says. To support a lonely or isolated friend with a handwritten letter keep these tips in mind: Don’t worry about finding the perfect thing to say. Emily McDowell is the writer and illustrator behind Emily McDowell & Friends a stationery brand known for its clever colorfully designed empathy cards. The cards were born of her experience having cancer at 24. “The hardest thing about having cancer was not losing my hair or those other things you hear about” she says. “It was the loneliness I felt when friends and family didn’t know what to say and ended up disappearing as a result.” Lee emphasizes the importance of being as sincere and personal as possible instead of focusing on writing the perfect message. “Sometimes we get so distracted trying to find the right things to say we don’t even realize that we sacrifice being absolutely genuine” she says. Picture the recipient before you begin writing. Instead of thinking about yourself and what to say envision the other person. What do you like about them? Why are you grateful to have them in your life? Have you ever learned anything meaningful from them? “If there’s anything you can think of that you learned from that person either directly or indirectly that’s very helpful” Lee says. “When we feel someone has benefited from us I think that boosts our self-esteem even if we don’t realize it.” Select a memorable piece of stationery. We all love the feeling of knowing that someone picked out a notecard just for us. Select a relevant pandemic-specific card (such as this one or this one) that your recipient will always remember. “When you’re in a tender moment you’re not going to be sitting on the floor sifting through 10000 text messages on the cloud to find the one that was meaningful” says Ali O’Grady founder and chief executive of Thoughtful Human one of the stationery brands participating in 18 Million Thanks. “You’re sitting on the floor going through your box of treasures.” Focus on the future. If possible share your hopes for something you wish to do or experience with the other person once the pandemic has ended. “That lens in the letter helps that person — and yourself — be a little bit more future-oriented” Lee says. “It exudes some hope.” Remember the elderly. Not only are older family members less likely to be tech-savvy enough for a video chat but they’re also more prone to loneliness Lee says. “I think they’re especially vulnerable throughout this pandemic for so many reasons” Lee says. “Letters could really impact their sense of loneliness and social connection in a powerful way.” Friedlander is a freelance writer based in Chicago.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/letters-pandemic-depression-anxiety-help/2020/09/14/47b3bb3a-f3b1-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Former students of defunct ITT Tech to receive $330 million in private student-loan forgiveness,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/09/15/former-students-defunct-itt-tech-receive-330-million-private-student-loan-forgiveness/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Eligible borrowers will be notified by PEAKS or their loan servicer and need to do nothing to receive forgiveness. At least 1100 former ITT Tech students in Maryland will receive relief while 1840 borrowers in Virginia will have their private loans canceled.“Maryland students were deceived when they were pressured into taking on these predatory loans” Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) said in a statement Tuesday. “PEAKS will be required by this settlement to provide debt relief to Maryland students who we allege were misled while they were working hard to further their education.”ITT Tech created two in-house student-loan programs as private lenders retreated from the market at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Banks stopped extending credit to students at for-profit colleges because of their historically high default rates.ITT Tech issued students “temporary credits” to cover remaining tuition after federal and private student loans were taken into account. Some former students said the credits were marketed as grants while others said they were told the credit would not have to be repaid until six months after graduation. But when the temporary credit became due ITT Tech allegedly pressured students into accepting loans with double-digit interest rates from PEAKS.According to the complaint students said they were pulled out of class or threatened with expulsion if they refused to accept the loan terms. Many of the former students lacked the means to continue their education and said they felt there were no other options than to accept the loans. Eighty percent of the loans fell into default as students could not keep up with payments.Even as students began defaulting in great numbers around 2011 ITT Tech continued issuing the high-cost loans. The tactics landed the company’s top brass in the crosshairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The federal agency settled fraud cases in 2018 against former ITT chief executive Kevin Modany and former chief financial officer Daniel Fitzpatrick for allegedly deceiving investors about high rates of late payments and defaults on student loans backed by the company.The SEC said executives made secret payments on delinquent accounts to delay defaults instead of disclosing the tens of millions of dollars in impending losses to investors. Executives assured investors in conference calls that the programs were performing well while ITT’s obligations to pay out on soured loans began to balloon according to that complaint.Before shutting down in 2016 ITT Tech was being investigated by more than a dozen state attorneys general and two federal agencies for alleged fraud deceptive marketing or steering students into predatory loans. That legal morass led an accrediting body to threaten to end its relationship with the chain which resulted in the Education Department curtailing ITT’s access to federal student aid.Days after closing 137 campuses and leaving 35000 students and 8000 employees in the lurch the company filed for bankruptcy protection to liquidate its business.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/09/15/former-students-defunct-itt-tech-receive-330-million-private-student-loan-forgiveness/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Kenya’s small-town singers hope coronavirus-inspired lyrics make for smash hits,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/kenya-coronavirus-songs/2020/09/14/48602156-e1ad-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Small studios across Kenya and East Africa are churning out thousands of “corona hits” across genres: reggae ballad hip-hop gospel and this region’s guitar-driven country music. The CEO of Ngomma one of the region’s biggest content aggregators which supplies YouTube and other streaming services with music and gets 300 million views a month says 60 percent of new music on the platform is explicitly about the coronavirus.The songs deal head-on with the economic pain inflicted on most Kenyans as a result of business closures and curfews and travel bans. Kenya never went into a total lockdown and so far hasn’t been overwhelmed by the virus but millions of mostly working-class people lost their jobs in a country where poverty is already entrenched.The artists who come into Jawabu Studios each have their own story of pandemic-era hardship but come out feeling freer of their burdens. To listeners the lyrics convey a sense of shared suffering during a crisis that for many has been at its most fundamental level about loneliness. In the cramped fifth-floor studio the lights dimmed and Malack Kamande 30 adjusted his headphones and positioned himself behind the mic. He normally makes extra cash as a paid choir singer but with church closed because of coronavirus restrictions he needed another outlet and another payday.Suddenly from the suspenseful silence he belted out his hit’s opening lines which also serve as the song’s title and theme: “Coronavirus! Where did it come from?”John Basil Siale who runs the studio and creates all the songs’ underlying beats with his synthesizer and electric guitar dropped in the bass lines and guitar riffs and gave Kamande a thumbs-up through the studio’s glass screen. No one within earshot could stifle a little jig or resist the urge to at least tap their feet.The somber subject matter didn’t stop the song from being a cheerful-sounding relentlessly upbeat banger.Malack Kamande via YouTube“I have been busy 24/7 since the pandemic started” said Siale who is from neighboring Tanzania. “I deal with one client a day. They have been producing corona songs — songs to pray to God to heal our countries. It has been a tough time actually but it has also brought income to my company.”Kenya is a deeply religious country but Kenyans are also known for their blunt sense of humor. Kamande drew from both when his song abruptly cut from chorus to an impromptu skit. He took his cellphone out of his pocket and dialed God’s number. The angel Gabriel for the moment working as God’s receptionist put him through.“Can you hear me?” asked Kamande.“I can hear you my child” God replied.Kamande then let loose a diatribe of the calamities that have befallen Kenya in recent times: floods locust plagues terrorism.“But the scariest of all is something called corona” he cried. “It’s killing our people in other places too Canada China everywhere. You are the only one who can help us God!”Just over 600 people are confirmed to have died in Kenya of complications of the coronavirus but fear of contagion runs deep. The country’s health-care system is weak and the government’s tone toward its citizens has been one of admonishment for rule-breakers rather than shared responsibility.Siale doesn’t make much off the recording sessions. He takes pity on those who’ve lost jobs and are hoping a smash hit will solve their problems. He gives almost everyone who comes in a steep discount.“People are looking for anything to lift them up. They are hoping to leverage coronavirus and become stars” said Thomas Mahondo the content aggregator executive. “Especially all these new artists. They sing about how their lives have been turned upside down and how they are hustling to get by.”Some are trying to get a message across too. Purity Mwikali 36 lost her aunt the woman who raised her to the coronavirus and was appalled that some Kenyans still refuse to believe that the disease exists.The plaintive refrain of the reggae single she recorded with Siale on a recent day goes: “One meter away quarantine until when?”“I loved my auntie” she said in an interview. “When I gave birth she was the one who assisted me. When she died the pain was too much. It led me to sing that song. Corona hurt me.”Both Kamande and Mwikali were nervous until the moment they got behind the mic.“That’s when all the stress goes away” Kamande said. “That’s when you let the music take over.”It’s the same for Kenyans who hear the coronavirus hits over loudspeakers in bars over the radio in shared cabs and through YouTube on their phones — the music with its witty lyrics about the pandemic makes the load feel a bit lighter.Mwikali hadn’t been behind the mic in seven years. She recorded one song back then but couldn’t afford any more sessions.“I come from a poor family so they told me to hold on to my dreams that they would figure something out” she said. “I lost my job some time back but fortunately I got a sponsor and I’m now at Jawabu Studios singing again. I continue to trust that God will come through for me.”Siale smiled and told her to relax.“Breathe in” he said. “It’s going to be a hit I’m sure of it.”Rael Ombuor contributed to this report.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/kenya-coronavirus-songs/2020/09/14/48602156-e1ad-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Jon Stewart urges health-care law for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/09/15/jon-stewart-burn-pits-veterans/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The wars in Afghanistan Iraq and elsewhere generated enormous amounts of waste including vehicle parts lithium-ion batteries solvents amputated limbs. U.S. contractors soaked the items in jet fuel and set them ablaze in hundreds of open-air burn pits some larger than a football field. Veterans advocates say service members exposed to the pits developed cancer and respiratory illnesses but the U.S. government has said the toxic substances are not conclusively linked to severe health conditions.In an address at the U.S. Capitol Stewart blasted lawmakers for not granting broad care and benefits to veterans sickened by burn pits and said the U.S. government has failed service members by setting an “almost impossibly high bar” to prove they were exposed to toxins.“War after war after war we treat them as expendable. And when they come home we’re done with them” Stewart said later Tuesday in an interview with The Washington Post. “If an enemy did this to us we’d … bomb them into oblivion. We did it to ourselves and we’re ignoring it.”As many as 3.5 million service members were exposed to burn pits and toxic chemicals during the first Gulf War through the global war on terrorism said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) who proposed the legislation with Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.). The measure would grant presumption of exposure to veterans with certain conditions and who served in one of 33 countries where troops were deployed after the 9/11 attacks Gillibrand said.That would reduce the burden of evidence they must currently provide she said such as exposure to specific burn pits and authoritative links to illnesses. That high bar has led to many denials of claims and care according to Gillibrand and advocates.VA has maintained there is not enough scientific evidence to conclusively link exposure and chronic health problems and evaluates claims on an individual basis.Danielle Robinson said her husband Heath Robinson developed stage-4 lung cancer after serving with the Ohio National Guard in Iraq where he lived near burn pits. Doctors said his condition was consistent with toxic exposure Robinson told reporters. He died in May.“My husband is dead because America poisoned its soldiers” Robinson said.Gillibrand told The Post she and other advocates have tried for years to broaden the scope of benefits and care for sickened veterans contending with other lawmakers and VA.“We’ve tried everything else” Gillibrand said. But the plight of New York first responders she said provided a helpful road map.“We did the epidemiology studies. We know the toxins created on 9/11 were the same at these burn pits” she said.The fight for presuming illnesses related to exposure is similar to the plight of Vietnam veterans who for decades were denied care for exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange. VA now presumes certain conditions are related to exposure based on deployment history rather than relying on the veteran to prove they encountered the chemical at a certain place.VA spokeswoman Christina Noel said eligibility requirements for VA health care and disability compensation are set by Congress. VA monitors the latest research on burn pits she said including a National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine study issued Friday.None of 27 severe illnesses met sufficient criteria to be linked to toxic exposure the report found and other conditions such as chronic persistent cough shortness of breath and wheezing had limited or suggestive links.Noel said the study found “insufficient evidence” linking respiratory illnesses and combat deployments. The report authors cautioned against such an interpretation saying incomplete data prevented researchers from drawing definitive conclusions.A tiny number of compensation claims filed since 2007 — more than 14000 out of nearly 16 million — are related to burn pits Noel said. She did not say how many of those were denied.VA could serve a more proactive role as a veterans health advocate Stewart said. “But VA is being purposefully obtuse and they’re purposely misdirecting people as a way of avoiding responsibility … they put veterans on almost a literal trial.”VA opened a burn pit registry for veterans to document health concerns and recently noted the 200000th registrant — a fraction of the overall number that may have been exposed.“It is past time that veterans exposed to these deadly toxins receive the benefits that they deserve” said Jeremy Butler the chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America an advocacy group that joined other veterans groups in endorsing the proposed bill.In Iraq one notoriously large pit in Balad burned continuously for years at one point incinerating 147 tons of waste per day Military Times reported.Military officials including an Air Force bioenvironmental engineer in 2006 cautioned that the Balad burn pit posed acute and chronic health risks Military Times reported.Stewart who was also a fierce proponent of extending the health fund for Sept. 11 first responders said the items burned at Balad and elsewhere included the remnants of firearms.“The smoking gun” Stewart said “is literally smoking guns.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/09/15/jon-stewart-burn-pits-veterans/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The European Parliament doesn’t want to spread the coronavirus by traveling to France. The French are furious.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/covid-european-parliament-strasbourg/2020/09/15/8cc1c9fa-f754-11ea-85f7-5941188a98cd_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“There is something behind it we cannot tolerate. Now we are not respecting European treaties” French Civil Service Minister Amélie de Montchalin told French radio on Tuesday. “The seat of the European Parliament is in Strasbourg. It is not a French invention. It is not a fantasy. It is written in the treaties.”The Strasbourg migration was enshrined in European treaties after French leaders successfully demanded a major European institution of their own. One goal was to prevent the 27-member political bloc from being overly centered in a single city.Many members of the European Parliament loathe the monthly journey which requires 705 lawmakers and thousands of staffers lobbyists and journalists to travel for at least four hours from Brussels. The circus typically arrives Monday afternoons and departs mid-Thursday. Trucks shuttle 6000 plastic trunks of files. The operation costs European taxpayers about $130 million a year.But French leaders are so attached to it that they are demanding the process carry on even in the middle of the pandemic when both Strasbourg and Brussels are viral hotspots.French Europe Minister Clément Beaune showed up to Strasbourg on Monday to show solidarity with the city where restaurants and taxi drivers are taking a hit from the parliamentary absence. Some hotels are going broke.The French like to tout that Strasbourg is a symbol of European peace since it passed between French and German control several times in recent centuries. Critics say Strasbourg is now also a symbol of European excess with restaurants catering to the lobbyists who bend lawmakers’ ears on the finer points of regulation that is approved there.As a matter of practicality most of the rest of the life of the European Union carries on in Brussels during ordinary times and most lawmakers except the French ones resent the schlep. Parliament has repeatedly voted to do away with the requirement although because it is required by treaty a change would require the unanimous consent of E.U. countries — and France appears unlikely to allow it any time soon.Still the virus trumps French demands at least for now. European Parliament President David Sassoli an Italian called off the Strasbourg plans earlier this month for health reasons promising to reconsider for next month’s session.Some lawmakers want to make the change permanent.“I’m glad Strasbourg is cancelled but it is not the wish of the parliament to return to Strasbourg” tweeted Jeroen Lenaers a Dutch member of the European Parliament. “The @Europarl_EN has consistently voted with large majority to abolish the unnecessary travel and adopt a single seat.”The parliament went largely virtual in March when the pandemic hit leaving this stretch the longest the parliament has gone without appearing in France in its history. This week’s plenary session is the first large-scale attempt to convene in-person and even now only 420 of the 705 lawmakers said they planned to come to Brussels according to Delphine Colard a spokeswoman for the parliament. Only 200 people will be allowed into the parliamentary chamber at any one time.With viral levels again spiking in Belgium some lawmakers who travel to Brussels will face quarantines once they go home. On Tuesday Belgium had 77 cases per 100000 residents over the past two weeks. France had 159 cases almost exactly the same as the United States. But indignant French lawmakers note that Brussels has more cases than Strasbourg.“Canceling the session in Strasbourg for fear of MEPs coming from all over Europe to a city facing a rebound of Covid-19 is a difficult thing but can still be understood” tweeted Christophe Grudler a French member of European Parliament. “But deciding unilaterally to transfer the same sessions to Brussels where sanitary risks are higher than Strasbourg is total nonsense.”Birnbaum reported from Riga Latvia.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/covid-european-parliament-strasbourg/2020/09/15/8cc1c9fa-f754-11ea-85f7-5941188a98cd_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
What Apple didn’t announce: An iPhone 12,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/15/iphone12-apple-event/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The omission isn’t a surprise but it’s still unusual. For a company that built its brand on innovation Apple has become pretty predictable. Every fall it announces its latest iPhones. The company has announced new iPhones every September since 2012. The year prior in 2011 the iPhone 4s was announced in October.However Apple has delayed the release of its phones before most recently the iPhone X which wasn’t in stores until November.When is the iPhone 12 coming?Analysts expect the new phones to be announced in October at the earliest. Apple confirmed that the iPhone would be late on an earnings call back in July when Luca Maestri the company’s chief financial officer said iPhone supply was going to be available a few weeks later than usual.A month might not seem like a big deal but Apple wants all its new products released and in stock ahead of the holiday rush. That should be especially true if that rush could be dampened by fewer people shopping in stores and families not having holiday gatherings because of the novel coronavirus.A month seems long. What am I even waiting for?Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models ranging in size from 5.4 to 6.7 inches. If they follow Apple’s most recent naming conventions — and the overused trend of slapping “Max” and “Pro” on the end of every product name — we could get an iPhone 12 iPhone 12 Max iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Minor upgrades could include tweaks to the exterior design and better cameras including a depth-sensing back camera. As for design the new iPad Air that Apple announced Tuesday has flat edges which could be a sign of what’s to come on any new iPhones.The main addition will likely be support for 5G the cellular network that promises lightning-fast download and upload speeds ... eventually.Every new iPhone needs one big enticing feature to persuade people to give up the still-functioning iPhone they bought two or so years ago. The iPhone 11 for example added an impressive lowlight mode and tried to make “slofies” happen. IPhone sales have been slowing for years thanks to an end to carrier subsidies and Apple offering inexpensive battery replacements. But with so many people stuck at home and connecting happily over their WiFi its unclear whether 5G will be the jolt to sales Apple wants.Why is it delayed? This is 2020. Up is down the country is simultaneously on fire and fending off hurricanes. Apple CEO Tim Cook is presenting new products to an invisible audience and we’re still in the throes of a pandemic that has hit Apple sales stores and production.Apple warned investors that the virus was disrupting production back in February. In addition to issues with its supply chain much of Apple’s U.S. staff has been working from home and its stores worldwide have had to shut down although many have reopened with new restrictions.Fine no iPhone 12 today. What can I buy soon?Apple announced two new Apple Watches including a lower-cost Apple Watch SE and the Apple Watch Series 6 which can measure blood oxygen levels. Both will be available September 18. A new 8th generation iPad will start at $329 and also be out at the end of week. The $599 and up iPad Air however isn’t coming until some time in October.Additionally sometime before the end of 2020 Apple says you’ll be able to sign up for the new Fitness+ service which will cost $10 a month. Its all-in-one Apple One bundle of various services is coming this fall starting at $15 a month.And the company already released a new phone earlier this year the lower-cost iPhone SE.

Air Force is playing only two games, and Navy isn’t too happy about it,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/ken-niumatalolo-navy-air-force/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“Where else in the country would you play for something of value and everybody’s schedules are not the same?” Niumatalolo said according to the Capital Gazette. “This is the No. 1 thing we fight for every year — the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy. We’re playing a full schedule. You got Air Force playing just two games? I don’t think those people care.“[Athletic Director] Chet [Gladchuk] and I talked but this is above us. This is guys at the Pentagon making decisions. I have no idea where they’re getting their data from. They didn’t get it from me so they’re not getting any football data. Like I said nobody asked me.”The Midshipmen have a full slate of 11 games scheduled while Air Force only has games against Navy and Army because of rescheduling forced by the coronavirus pandemic. The Mountain West Conference postponed its season and Air Force is a member institution. Army also has a full slate of games though this week’s game against BYU was postponed because of an outbreak within the Cougars’ program.Niumatalolo previously voiced his displeasure with a scenario in which one of the schools would have months to practice and prepare for Navy while the Mids play other teams and take physical punishment on a weekly basis. Air Force has Navy scheduled for a home game Oct. 3 and Army for a road game Nov. 7.The announcement was made Monday that the Commander-in-Chief’s series will continue in 2020.“Guys that have no idea what is going on with the programs” Niumatalolo said according to the Capital Gazette. “Whenever you have guys at the Pentagon making football decisions which to me is crazy.”Niumatalolo apologized on Monday night in a statement to the Capital Gazette.“I should not have said some of the stuff I said and I’m sorry I did” Niumatalolo said. “The Pentagon has nothing to do with this and it was wrong of me to suggest that was the case. I was just frustrated and let my emotions get the best of me.“The Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy is our program’s No. 1 goal every year and we put our heart and soul into getting it back last year.”Navy is off to a rough start after losing 55-3 to BYU in the season opener Sept. 7. Navy altered its shortened offseason practices to be extra cautious against the spread of the coronavirus and attempted to eliminate most face-to-face interactions. That included tackling dummies and blocking pads instead of live contact. The Midshipmen were woefully unprepared to face BYU and Niumatalolo took responsibility for making the decision about the way they practiced. The team reversed course and resumed normal practices this week after testing was increased to three times a week per American Athletic Conference rules. Navy is set to play at Tulane on Saturday.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/15/ken-niumatalolo-navy-air-force/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Air Force seeks a radical shift in how jets, missiles and satellites are designed,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/air-force-digital-design/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Now Roper wants to make this sort of process a requirement for companies building any of the Air Force’s premier systems in the future. He is hoping to usher in a new era of weapons development in which computer-generated models — owned by the government and enabled by artificial intelligence technology — can test millions of possible designs in a virtual format before ever creating a prototype.In this case the outcome that seemed to impress him the most was the plane’s low price. Boeing’s Arlington-based defense division is known in the aerospace world for underbidding its rivals.“For me the Sputnik moment was looking under the hood at T-7” Roper said. “The airplane came in at a much lower cost than we expected which begs the question: How? That took me on the odyssey of how it was designed and assembled.”What surprised Roper about the design process for the T-7 was the use of what’s known as “digital threading” in which designers created a digital twin for the jet before manufacturing it. Starting in a virtual format means they can modify and test the plane’s systems with various configurations over the course of its design.For Boeing seeing a top Air Force official hold up the T-7 as a model for aircraft design should come as a welcome reprieve at a difficult time. The company’s reputation for sound engineering has been called into question over design flaws in the 737 Max commercial jetliner which went undiscovered until a pair of plane crashes killed 346 people. Boeing’s defense and space division despite problems with the KC-46 tanker and the Starliner capsule has been more stable by comparison.Roper recognized that a mostly digital design process represented a significant departure from the traditional way of doing things.“There is an old adage in defense acquisition called ‘fly before you buy.’ It’s a caution that you ought to build something and test it out before you commit to buying it” Roper said. “Today you can digitally buy and fly before you even commit to buying that first prototype. Let’s do that in the military and then we can design things more frequently.​​”Using a digital thread in the design process allows automated checks to happen in the background as the product is modified essentially ensuring that as different parts of a plane or missile system are designed they all fit together and don’t face integration problems.Roper said that in the past with the manual design of aircraft small differences in parts that don’t fit together well can end up becoming big problems ― like when you are trying to put together a piece of furniture from Ikea and for some reason the holes don’t line up. Even a variance of a thousandth of an inch within a complicated system can create expensive headaches.Mechanics can also learn how to assemble the plane digitally. For the Red Hawk Roper said mechanics were trained in a simulator to build the aircraft before it was ever put together in the real world.“They achieved the same quality on their first airplane that would normally be achieved on the hundredth” Roper said because they came with the experience of having built the plane digitally.Because of the approach Roper said the Air Force has been able to complete assembly and subsequent maintenance of the T-7 in record time which he described as “off the charts not near any other airplane in recorded history.”It remains to be seen whether the T-7 will live up to expectations. It’s possible the low price and faster assembly process could entail trade-offs in other areas.The U.S. Space Force which was created out of the Air Force last year also will apply this method to new system designs including the missile system that will replace the Minuteman III ICBM fleet. Roper said Northrop Grumman created a digital twin and tried out over 6 billion different variants of the new ICBM using artificial intelligence and machine learning to weigh the trade-offs between cost and different possible characteristics.It is also employing it to design a futuristic fighter jet meant to follow current aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter under a program called Next Generation Air Dominance or NGAD. That program has progressed to the point where a physical prototype ― already designed assembled and tested in a virtual system ― has been flown Roper said Tuesday.If this approach is expected to become the norm it will require a significant shift for U.S. weapons makers. An Air Force spokeswoman said the department does not yet have a written policy requiring digital design processes but is working on one. Roper says he considers the new approach to be a mandate for which any exception requires his personal sign-off.This kind of process shift ― particularly the related requirement that the digital technology be fully owned by the government ― could be controversial for large defense companies that prefer to own and profit from the intellectual property underlying their products.Hawk Carlisle a retired Air Force general who now leads the National Defense Industrial Association said a range of proprietary digital engineering efforts are already underway. He added that the defense industry on the whole would do well to transform its development process accordingly. With digital engineering “you can produce an airplane that is much faster has fewer challenges in the manufacturing process and is much more accurate and perfect. This is the way we have to go and it’s about getting speed and capability out to the warfighter quickly” he said.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/15/air-force-digital-design/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Meg’s choice: She could reopen her diner. But what about the hungry people she’s feeding?,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/diners-coronavirus-kansas-reopen/2020/09/14/b8cd1b6a-d33e-11ea-8d32-1ebf4e9d8e0d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The “Fresh Daily” case was empty now the turquoise vinyl booths devoid of diners and the rotating dessert tower turned into temporary storage for loaves of bread.Days after Heriford closed her doors in March and laid off her staff she and two former employees began making sack lunches for anybody in town who needed one — “no strings no questions no substitutions.” The need was acute — the homeless population had been increasing even before the pandemic with 9100 people in the county out of work in April about a quarter of them from the food service industry.At first it was a simple: white paper bags with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and some chips but word spread quickly. Eventually they were feeding more than 200 a day in a program funded by community donations some 13000 meals for furloughed factory workers laid-off bartenders cleaners with no homes to clean mechanics with nothing to repair.Now her state is in the middle of a rocky reopening and Heriford 46 finds herself facing the same tough decisions many restaurateurs and chefs are grappling with across the country as the restaurant industry recovery has stalled and the United States remains in the grip of the deadly coronavirus.Amid this pandemic summer some restaurants have yet to reopen still struggling to find a workable way forward with diminished capacity or takeout only. Others tried to restart only to shut down again as cases surged. And many more are gone forever — more than 20000 restaurants have closed nationwide since the start of the pandemic according to the National Restaurant Association with tens of thousands more expected to close.In Lawrence’s downtown nearly a third of the restaurants have either delayed reopening reopened and then scuttled indoor dining — or closed altogether.Heriford faced an agonizing choice — should she try to reopen Ladybird Diner as it was and if so what about the people she’s feeding — the newly destitute families who come shyly pushing their masked kids to the front of the line? Or Jerry the local busker who treats her to a slightly off-key serenade every day?She’s been a small-business owner and a fixture in this Midwestern town for years but now the pandemic had changed everything. And changed her.“This is noble work feeding people. I don’t want to cheapen it to try to cram as many nickels as I can into the piggy bank” she said.But she also had her own family to feed.A growing needThey were already waiting in line by the time the doors opened. First came some homeless residents toting backpacks and bedrolls whom Heriford fondly calls “the regulars.” The families and those who have been recently laid off unused to the formalities of need waited in their cars.Heriford and former employee Erin Brown wheeled out three tall racks of roast beef and cheese sandwiches brats and pasta in paper cartons the scent of garlic and tomato sauce wafting through the warm summer air.“Hi good morning!” Heriford said. “Let’s do kids first.”“Can I take two?” one woman asked.“Can I take one for my fiance?” asked another.“You can always take as much as you need” said Brown.An unemployed landscaper arrived with his 11-year-old son in tow breathless.“Am I too late?” he asked. “I thought I was early.”Jerry the busker with a white sea captain’s beard took two roast beef sandwiches to his favorite bench and ate watching as the rest of the lunches disappeared so quickly Heriford was left shaken.Before it was fun to run out of things at the diner to hear the call of “86 coconut cream!” ringing from server to server in the tightly packed cafe. Now when they run out Heriford has to direct people to the Salvation Army or the church up the street or quickly throw together a make-do bag with whatever extras they have in hand.“It felt really awful. It went so fast” Heriford said. “That sense of urgency feels overwhelming. People were stressing out. I was thinking ‘Oh my God what am I going to do with all these hungry people?’ ”Lawrence is a liberal bastion in a county of 121400 residents in a red state where life revolves around the University of Kansas. With a plethora of students and service workers the county has a far higher percentage of people living in poverty than the state overall — 18 percent vs. 12 percent. Its homeless census grew 39 percent over the past two years which organizers said was from better counting as well as increased need.Jerry used to spend his days at the library sitting in an Internet station with his ear buds reading up on music theory or practicing tunes with an online metronome. But now the library is only allowing patrons in for short periods of time “express service” which leaves him at loose ends.“I couldn’t imagine trying to get through winter with nowhere to go” he said. “Will it kill me? I don’t know. But it will kill a lot of people.”In the early days of the pandemic when things still seemed temporary it was easy for Heriford to imagine a day when she’d be able to invite him to sit at the counter for a meal.“It will be such a happy day when we can invite Jerry inside” she had said earlier to Brown as they dropped single-serving Oreo packages and apples into paper bags assembly-line style. Brown’s wife Channon Nitz was in the kitchen preparing sandwiches.“What will he order I wonder?” Brown said.“That sounds about right” Brown said.“He really deserves it” Heriford said. “Talk about staying cheerful. When he was singing that Woody Guthrie song the other day I was transported to another century.”Each day when the crowd dissipates Jerry pulls out his harmonica and sings them a little tune his choice in keeping with the mood of the day. One day it was Woody Guthrie. One day — when Nitz made Creole stew — it was Hank Williams’s “On the Bayou.”Heriford had been thinking for weeks about what reopening the diner would mean how it would look how she would keep her 30 employees safe. She and her partners — including Matt Hyde who owns the fancier restaurant three doors up where Heriford got her start — pored over restaurant group websites from California to Hong Kong. They read the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. They talked to the county health department.She entertained the idea of servers and cooks in masks and face shields temperature checks space-age dining pods elaborate disinfection systems. Accessing government help for small businesses such as the Paycheck Protection Program would be difficult because the diner’s tiny space — a kitchen of only 6 by 10 feet — meant it would be difficult to socially distance cooks as required.Each day at the diner had been a show rough and imperfect but danced through with joy with baby-kissing laughter and high-fives.Who were they without those things?A new planOne afternoon Heriford’s landlord Bob Schumm stopped by to say hello weaving his way through the lime green plastic chairs that serve as barricades to keep passersby out of the restaurant.“When are you guys reopening?” Schumm asked his voice muffled through his mask.Heriford was vague. What she didn’t tell her landlord — “It’s a longer conversation” she said — was she was trying to come up with a model to continue free lunches as well as make a little money.She opened the diner in 2014 filing it with antique stools from North Carolina old-fashioned ice cream glasses and colorful Pyrex bowls turned upside for lights because she couldn’t afford pricey fixtures.She was working at Hyde’s farm-to-table 715 Restaurant as a waitress and occasional pastry chef when he asked her one night if she would make a pie. She chose one of the simplest — buttermilk. Just egg yolks buttermilk heavy cream sugar cornmeal and a lacing of fresh nutmeg on top.When it sold out in an hour Hyde and his other partners began looking for a place for her to make pies full time.She named the cafe after Ladybird Johnson the former first lady who made everything beautiful. Pies were on the menu of course — “pies people connect with pies with resonance time-traveler pies” — along with the chicken and noodles like her grandmother used to make.The neon sign outside said simply: “EAT.”The diner quickly gained a loyal following with more than 30000 likes on its Facebook page.Continuing the food program without reopening the diner would set Heriford on a path of financial uncertainty. It is the primary source of income for her family — her songwriter husband Arthur and the three of her four children who remain at home: Macie 17 Eula 11 and Ilsa 7. Her oldest Billy Duke lost his job as a cook at the cafe when it shut.Already the family was surviving on a lot of rice and beans augmenting with vegetables from the garden. Depleting their savings and refinancing the house was the next option she and Arthur decided. She joked they had just enough wiggle room to make some terrible financial decisions but deep down she worried — would it be reckless?“I don’t have a lot of skills so it’s not like if this doesn’t work out I can be a plumber or something” she said.That’s happening everywhere: Restaurants across the country that became soup kitchens in the early days of the pandemic are facing the same uncertainty even as need persists. Celebrity chef José Andrés’s foundation has spent $86 million supporting more than 2000 restaurants doing similar free meals in similar fashion to Heriford’s independent effort. But that bulk of money was to have run out by the end of August the nonprofit said.Heriford waited weeks for her unemployment benefits along with thousands of others delayed by the state’s overwhelmed system. She has been using the restaurant’s line of credit to pay the $5000 monthly rent. Donations for the lunches are drying up.In the evenings while Arthur and the girls were asleep she opened her grease-splattered MacBook Air and began making a plan for the Ladybird Diner Community Kitchen and Market a combined community kitchen with a store selling fresh produce and prepared meals.When Heriford presented her partners — Hyde and two other local business executives — with the new vision they were supportive but reluctant to accrue any more debt. Hyde is trying to reopen his own restaurant with mostly outdoor seating in September.“I realize the challenges are daunting” Hyde said. “But if I had to put all of my eggs in a basket to make something work I would put them in Meg’s basket. She’s like Yoda to me.”Afternoons at the diner are quieter more contemplative as they assemble pantry boxes of staples to see families through weekends when they’re not serving lunch.Older donors who can’t figure out Venmo stop by and leave crumpled $20 bills that sit by the cash register until they’re safe to touch. People drive by and toot their horns. Heriford’s daughter Macie who has worked at the diner since she was 14 comes by to help.Her former employees have picked up pantry boxes for their own families or just come by to say hi.One afternoon Jessica Manlove 31 pulled up in front of the restaurant with her husband and two kids in a black truck with a busted muffler and monster wheels. The couple is trying to survive the pandemic with a scrap metal business they call “Redneck Recycling.” Their stove was on the fritz so Heriford called for donations on the Facebook page ending up with a microwave and a toaster oven.Heriford lugged the appliances out into the street along with a pantry box she’d tailored for Manlove and her family with some staple food items Hot Pockets and prepared soups and stews.“I’m trying to file for unemployment but I couldn’t get through” Manlove said. “I stayed on the line for an hour hitting the button again and again. How long before it gets better?”“I got through this morning so stay with it” Heriford counseled.“Are you doing sack lunches too right now?” Manlove asked. Heriford added four bags with peanut butter sandwiches chips and granola bars to the box.'Time to say goodbye'It was Jerry who finally led her to the solution. As the sun came out after a rainy night he stepped up to the patio railing for her daily serenade singing the old Johnny Nash song “I Can See Clearly Now” and playing the harmonica they bought for him.She decided whatever rebirth would happen for Ladybird had to include Jerry and the rest of the hungry people she’d been serving.“I can’t write them out of it” she said. “Maybe it will work maybe it doesn’t. But it definitely feels like it’s worth a shot.”She went home and broke the news to her family over dinner and then emailed her staff.“It’s time to say goodbye to what we were at least for while” she wrote. Already “I miss ‘us.’ ”The way forward looked hard. There was not a five-year plan. There was not a six-month plan. Thirty days was all she could do.For now she would move forward with the community kitchen and market spending August fundraising for the free lunch programs by putting together a book of essays on diner life called “Ladybird Collected.” She needs more than $100000 to hire back eight staffers keep the feeding program going into the fall and possibly open the new market by the end of the year.A few days later she was back at work thinking through the possibilities as she made herself an iced coffee behind the bar mentally redecorating the space planning where the new cases for takeout meals to-go pie slices and batched homemade cocktails would go. The bar was still as it had been left in March — a chalkboard sign still advertised the local beer offerings fairy lights still twinkled around a bust of Elvis.“It’s hard because I haven’t had time to say a proper goodbye to Ladybird” she said. “There’s no way to do it now. It’s already gone.”There was no time to mourn. Outside the regulars were lining up at the door and they were ready to eat.Julie Tate contributed to this report.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/diners-coronavirus-kansas-reopen/2020/09/14/b8cd1b6a-d33e-11ea-8d32-1ebf4e9d8e0d_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
John Boyega steps down from perfume partnership after being replaced in an ad: ‘I don’t have time for nonsense’,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/09/15/john-boyega-replaced-jo-malone-commercial/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Jo Malone’s “decision to replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me without either my consent or prior notice was wrong. The film celebrated my personal story — showcasing my hometown including my friends and featuring my family” Boyega tweeted Monday evening continuing: “While many brands understandably use a variety of global and local ambassadors dismissively trading out one’s culture this way is not something I can condone.”The company apologized over the weekend in a statement sent to the Hollywood Reporter referring to the Chinese market version as “a mistake” and admitting that Boyega’s vision “should not have been replicated.” The 28-year-old actor joined the brand last year as its first male global ambassador he noted on Twitter adding that the campaign launched with the short he created had won an industry award.This is the latest high-profile instance of Boyega advocating for himself. His British GQ interview made waves this month after he criticized the way his character’s story line was handled in the Star Wars sequel trilogy — the sort of candor that is a rarity for franchise actors. Finn a former Stormtrooper figured prominently in 2015′s “The Force Awakens” but was sidelined in the next two films in favor of characters like Rey and Kylo Ren both played by White actors (Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver).“You get yourself involved in projects and you’re not necessarily going to like everything” Boyega said. "[But] what I would say to Disney is do not bring out a black character market them to be much more important in the franchise than they are and then have them pushed to the side. It’s not good. I’ll say it straight up.”In that same interview Boyega commented on how being Black led to a unique experience on the franchise which he wrapped work on with last year’s “The Rise of Skywalker.” None of his castmates “had the uproar and death threats sent to their Instagram DMs and social media saying ‘Black this and black that and you shouldn’t be a Stormtrooper.’ Nobody else had that experience."“But yet people are surprised that I’m this way” he continued. “That’s my frustration.”Boyega’s outspokenness extends beyond his work. After the killing of George Floyd the actor was filmed speaking at a June protest in London’s Hyde Park shouting to the crowd “I need you to understand how painful it is to be reminded every day that your race means nothing.” In a part of his speech that went viral he noted “I don’t know if I’m going to have a career after this but f--- that.” Directors including Jordan Peele Edgar Wright and Cathy Yan rallied behind him joining an outpouring of support on social media.In his Twitter thread on the Jo Malone incident Boyega wrote that it would be “dealt with swiftly.”“I don’t have time for nonsense” he stated. “We press on and strong.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/09/15/john-boyega-replaced-jo-malone-commercial/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Who needs another Zoom call? Why sending letters might help your loved ones.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/letters-pandemic-depression-anxiety-help/2020/09/14/47b3bb3a-f3b1-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
But we can take another approach: sending handwritten letters. The old-fashioned gesture could be particularly beneficial now: The pandemic is adversely affecting Americans’ mental health and research suggests that being contacted by letter can lower the risk of suicide. Besides after months of remote work and virtual communication many people might welcome a tangible alternative to yet another Zoom call. Feel awkward writing a nondigital missive? No worries we have you covered.If you know someone who is troubled that person is not alone. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there has been a stark increase in emotional distress among Americans since the pandemic began. In June nearly 31 percent of U.S. adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression while almost 11 percent said that they had seriously considered suicide. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms alone was about triple that of the same time period in 2019.One contributing factor to the national mental health struggle during the pandemic has been the ongoing social isolation plaguing millions of Americans. It’s the greatest concern of Amanda Spray clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. “Social isolation is a symptom of depression” she says “and it leads to worsening of depression.”“[Letters] help provide social support even if you can’t be there with your friend or family member holding their hand and being by their side” says Spray who is also the director of the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Center at NYU Langone Health.Research indicates that such support can have a significant impact on recipients’ mental health. One study conducted at Stanford University in the early 1970s followed more than 800 people after they had been discharged from the hospital for depression or suicidal tendencies. One group of patients received handwritten letters from a health-care provider they knew in the five years following discharge while the other group received no letters. Patients in the letter-receiving group had lower rates of suicide over the five-year period.A more recent study looked at a new treatment for those who recently attempted suicide. The treatment involved three therapy sessions followed by two years of receiving personalized letters. There was an approximately 80 percent reduced risk of a repeat suicide attempt in the group who received letters.Psychiatrist Jena Lee medical director of pediatric emergency psychiatry at UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital says that when patients are at a crisis point — meaning they’ve attempted suicide or are seriously considering it — they often can’t name one person they trust or who they know cares about them. Letters can counter that feeling.“If I had a superpower and could change one thing for everyone that would make the biggest impact for all mental illness it would be that everyone had one person who cares for them” Lee says.The medium is as important as the message. People consider letters meaningful because so much effort goes into sending them. It takes time to find the right stationery think about what to write buy postage stamps look up the person’s address and find a postbox. “It requires a kind of deliberation that is so lacking in our time of fast-paced messaging and media” Lee says. “When you receive a handwritten letter you reflexively start imagining the author sitting down and reflecting thinking about you. . . . That’s why it’s so very effective at showing someone does care about you.”Early in the pandemic Good Juju Ink a stationery brand headquartered in San Francisco launched 18 Million Thanks an initiative designed to support front-line workers through handwritten cards. Ryan Kissick head of operations for Good Juju Ink says one registered nurse in Alaska got in touch with them after receiving a letter.“She said ‘This is not a fun time to be a nurse. I got a thank-you note from a patient’s spouse and I sobbed. It does matter. We are making a difference. We are all in this together’ ” Kissick says.To support a lonely or isolated friend with a handwritten letter keep these tips in mind: Don’t worry about finding the perfect thing to say. Emily McDowell is the writer and illustrator behind Emily McDowell & Friends a stationery brand known for its clever colorfully designed empathy cards. The cards were born of her experience having cancer at 24.“The hardest thing about having cancer was not losing my hair or those other things you hear about” she says. “It was the loneliness I felt when friends and family didn’t know what to say and ended up disappearing as a result.”Lee emphasizes the importance of being as sincere and personal as possible instead of focusing on writing the perfect message. “Sometimes we get so distracted trying to find the right things to say we don’t even realize that we sacrifice being absolutely genuine” she says.Picture the recipient before you begin writing. Instead of thinking about yourself and what to say envision the other person. What do you like about them? Why are you grateful to have them in your life? Have you ever learned anything meaningful from them?“If there’s anything you can think of that you learned from that person either directly or indirectly that’s very helpful” Lee says. “When we feel someone has benefited from us I think that boosts our self-esteem even if we don’t realize it.”Select a memorable piece of stationery. We all love the feeling of knowing that someone picked out a notecard just for us. Select a relevant pandemic-specific card (such as this one or this one) that your recipient will always remember. “When you’re in a tender moment you’re not going to be sitting on the floor sifting through 10000 text messages on the cloud to find the one that was meaningful” says Ali O’Grady founder and chief executive of Thoughtful Human one of the stationery brands participating in 18 Million Thanks. “You’re sitting on the floor going through your box of treasures.”Focus on the future. If possible share your hopes for something you wish to do or experience with the other person once the pandemic has ended. “That lens in the letter helps that person — and yourself — be a little bit more future-oriented” Lee says. “It exudes some hope.”Remember the elderly. Not only are older family members less likely to be tech-savvy enough for a video chat but they’re also more prone to loneliness Lee says.“I think they’re especially vulnerable throughout this pandemic for so many reasons” Lee says. “Letters could really impact their sense of loneliness and social connection in a powerful way.”Friedlander is a freelance writer based in Chicago.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/letters-pandemic-depression-anxiety-help/2020/09/14/47b3bb3a-f3b1-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Lawsuit claims United favors young, blond attendants to staff NFL, MLB team flights,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/09/14/united-sued-nfl-mlb-discrimation-lawsuit/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Two veteran flight attendants are suing United Airlines for discrimination saying that the airline favors young blond blue-eyed crew members when assigning for flights that serve the NFL NCAA and MLB according to a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California. The flight attendants Kim Guillory and Sharon Tesler have worked for United Airlines for 28 and 34 years respectively. “United has created a despicable situation” the women said in the complaint by unlawfully enacting “procedures that are designed to ensure that young white blond/blue-eyed female employees receive positions with the charter program.” The lawsuit says more senior Black and Jewish employees are not assigned to the flights and that the plaintiffs were told by supervisors that they were not on the “preferred” crew list for the charters. [If you’re traveling for the holidays now is the time to book flights] Guillory and Tesler who are Black and Jewish respectively say they discovered that the women on the list were all young White and have less seniority than them. The sports team flights are coveted flight assignments “since attendants earn more money and can receive perks such as prime tickets and infield passes” according to Yahoo Sports. The women are seeking monetary damages from United. The airline however says its chartered flights which shuttle sports teams traveling around the United States have race and age averages in line with those of the crews on its standard commercial flights. “While we cannot comment on this ongoing litigation the flight attendants included in our sports team charter program are largely representative of our overall flight attendant population in regards to age and race” a spokesperson for United told The Washington Post via email. “Flight attendant eligibility to work a charter flight is based solely on performance and attendance and has nothing to do with age race or gender.” “United Airlines is proud of our track record on diversity equity and inclusion” the airline said. The average flight attendant on a United sports charter flight is 46 years old the airline said and the average tenure is over 19 years. United also notes: “We have a higher percentage of African Americans in our sports team charter program than in our overall flight attendant population.” Read more: Covid eliminated airline change fees — but they could return incognito experts say Miami airport officials seize $490000 stuffed into an accent chair passing through customs Why you should use miles instead of cash to buy flights right now,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/09/14/united-sued-nfl-mlb-discrimation-lawsuit/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Review | The key to a more tranquil mind? One author argues it’s all about revisiting books from the past.,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/the-key-to-a-more-tranquil-mind-one-author-argues-its-all-about-revisiting-books-from-the-past/2020/09/15/25c1aeb8-f764-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Jacobs a Christian intellectual with a long list of publications on English literature theology and history gained mainstream readers in recent years with a couple of general-interest titles. “The Pleasures of Reading in an Age of Distraction” and “How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds” were erudite yet accessible and his support for the tolerance of opposing ideas has appealed to the moderate-minded. Much of what he says here about “the value of paying attention to old books” will sound supremely reasonable to those who believe it is good to read them and to read as many of them as possible. Some of what he says and in certain cases what he neglects to say will remind readers why they should broaden their tastes beyond the Western canon.This book is a response at least in part to what Jacobs describes as “a common current attitude: all history hitherto is at best a sewer of racism sexism homophobia and general social injustice at worst an abattoir which no reasonable person would even want to peek at.” The tone of that line notwithstanding he subsequently clarifies he wants readers “to acknowledge the current call to name injustice for what it is while denying that that calls for old books to be thrown in the trash or simply ignored.” This author often takes some palpable pains to deliver his own thoughts inoffensively (although he doesn’t always avoid what woke readers will see as cringeworthy phrasing). His rhetorical strategy is not to debate the content of old books but to appeal to people’s self-interest.Reading from and about history — or “breaking bread with the dead” as the quoted W.H. Auden line has it — doesn’t just deepen our understanding of the past Jacobs argues; that deeper understanding increases our own “personal density.” (In Thomas Pynchon’s novel “Gravity’s Rainbow” personal density is described as “directly proportional to temporal bandwidth” which is “the width of your present your now.”)Today Jacobs writes we live so distractedly so situationally that “we lack the density to stay put even in the mildest breeze from our news feeds.” And “to acquire the requisite density you have to get out of your transitory moment and into bigger time.”But what to do for example with the sexism of “The Iliad” the racism and colonialism of “Robinson Crusoe” the anti-Semitism of the “House of Mirth”? Jacobs believes those issues should be reckoned with and that means reading the books. “We sift the past for its wisdom and its wickedness its perception and its foolishness” he writes.When you can’t stomach the text he says you can always close the book. “Here’s one of the most important traits of authors of old books: they’re dead. You can neither punish them nor reward them.” (Of course that conveniently leaves out more complicated cases of living authors who can be punished or rewarded or dare I say it canceled.)Jacobs praises the “cold-eyed clarity” with which the English historian C.V. Wedgwood wrote about the moral and ethical deficiencies and mendacities of the figures involved in the Thirty Years War and the English Civil War. She was “never surprised by them” he writes. And maybe we shouldn’t be surprised by the sheer brutality of human history perhaps even of human nature. With respect to the hypocrisies and inconsistencies of our ancestors he writes: “If we understand that this pervasive inconsistency this inability to transcend the interests of people who look or act or believe just like us is universal then perhaps — just perhaps — we will be less likely to believe that we are immune to it.”Jacobs is a proponent of difference and distance as a means of increasing perspective. There are a number of stories here of figures who have gained insight from authors across time and culture. In recent years for example the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh has found that he was better able to fathom the enormity of climate change from reading pre-modern Bengali literature. Other examples he supplies — how Frederick Douglass “treasured the words of an Irishman speaking in the British Parliament” on the suppression of the Catholic church; the way Zadie Smith found a role model in the Romantic poet John Keats — tend to remind us that non-White non-male readers have been doing this reaching beyond cultural boundaries and finding meaningful connection in works by White men for centuries.They’ve had to. Because of course what can be read from “the past” — what is available to be read what is assigned to you in school — is a function of who had the status and wherewithal to write publish or translate it in the first place.If reading helps us understand ourselves better by understanding others then maybe Jacobs has missed an opportunity to show the degree to which he has benefited from his own reading beyond the Western ethnocentric norm.Jacobs says that when we pick up an old book we know that “another human being from another world has spoken to us.” That sense of appreciation may well be applied to the work of all writers living and dead. There are many worlds past and present from which another may speak.John Glassie is the author of “A Man of Misconceptions: The Life of an Eccentric in an Age of Change.”Breaking Bread With the DeadA Reader’s Guide to a More Tranquil MindPenguin Press. 192 pp. $25.00,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/the-key-to-a-more-tranquil-mind-one-author-argues-its-all-about-revisiting-books-from-the-past/2020/09/15/25c1aeb8-f764-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
At D.C. maternal health summit, focus on coronavirus impact,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/at-dc-maternal-health-summit-focus-on-coronavirus-impact/2020/09/15/013f641e-f6c3-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The four-day online summit which ends Friday focuses on the impact of the novel coronavirus on pregnant women mothers and children. It includes sessions that focus on parenting during the pandemic building early literacy skills for children and managing perinatal mood disorders.Even before the pandemic D.C. had a higher rate of deaths related to pregnancy than the national average and a wide gap in the mortality rates between Black and White mothers.Health-care professionals who work in the region say the stay-home orders and economic distress triggered by the pandemic and the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on poor and minority residents could worsen those disparities.“We were just at a point of where we were having more conversations specifically around birth disparities and the challenges why the system is not working and covid just drew even more light on that” Ebony Marcelle director of midwifery at Community of Hope a health center in D.C. said in an interview.“When caring for women who need more help distancing does not help” Marcelle said.The rate for Black women is significantly higher: 71 deaths per 100000 live births in D.C. compared with 63.8 nationally. The city’s infant mortality rate is 7.1 per 1000 births compared with 5.9 per 1000 births nationally according to the D.C. Department of Health.Tollie Elliott chief medical officer at the Mary’s Center health clinics said in an interview that some patients have skipped appointments in recent months because they are concerned about getting sick — a decision that can be especially dangerous for pregnant mothers.“Any time you have a disruption in prenatal care it can lead to missed labs missed information you’re supposed to give the patient” Elliott said. “It can lead to a missed opportunity to make sure that you’re engaged with the patient that the baby is moving appropriately that the heart tone sounds normal.”More than 20000 pregnant women nationally have tested positive for the coronavirus and 44 pregnant women have died of covid-19 the disease caused by the virus according to initial data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those women were Hispanic or Latina which tracks with what doctors in the D.C. region say they have seen.Pregnant women with the illness are more likely to be hospitalized be admitted to intensive care units and receive ventilation than nonpregnant women.Experts say mortality related to pregnancy is one of the major contributors to the Black-White life-expectancy gap in the District. Black women in the nation’s capital died 12 years earlier on average than their White counterparts according to a recent study.About half of Black women in D.C. and more than 1 in 3 Hispanic women didn’t get prenatal care until their second or third trimester according to a 2018 city report.And many low-income women in the city find it difficult to get the postpartum care they need even though mothers in D.C. can seek prenatal care at 39 facilities over 60 percent of which accept Medicaid or Alliance the District’s health insurance plan.United Medical Center the only hospital east of the Anacostia River closed its maternity ward in 2017 after the death of Somesha Ayobo a pregnant woman whose care was interrupted. The closure came months after Providence Hospital which served low-income women closed its maternity services.Low-income women who live east of the river have since found themselves having to travel long distances to get pre- and postnatal care.Aletha Maybank the chief health equity officer for the American Medical Association spoke at the summit Tuesday and attributed some race-related health disparities to bias among health-care providers — both in the District and nationwide.“What covid does is just exacerbate all of that” Maybank said. “It is the same explanations the similar structural issues the similar provider issues as it relates to injustices. And there’s just so much pressure on families especially for Black women who are usually holding many of their families together.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/at-dc-maternal-health-summit-focus-on-coronavirus-impact/2020/09/15/013f641e-f6c3-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
School, but an ‘undead version’: Students, parents and teachers in Northern Virginia adjust to online learning,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/school-but-an-undead-version-students-parents-and-teachers-in-northern-virginia-adjust-to-online-learning/2020/09/15/f3ea7cd0-f75e-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“Margie went into the schoolroom . . . and the mechanical teacher was on and waiting for her” the passage reads. “The screen was lit up and it said: ‘Today’s arithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper fractions. Please insert yesterday’s homework in the proper slot.’ Margie did so with a sigh.”These days Bradley — who teaches middle school in Fairfax County Public Schools — feels a lot like the “mechanical teacher.” He spends every morning huddled in a spare room in his Northern Virginia home staring at his computer screen. The monitor is filled with small rectangles: Each one depicts an anonymous identical silhouette.These Bradley explained are his students. Most keep their cameras off.“Sometimes” he said “you feel as if you’re speaking to thin air. Or to no one at all.”One week into remote schooling students parents and teachers throughout Northern Virginia — where all major public school districts are conducting online-only learning — are slowly adjusting to their new virtual reality. The first week of school-from-a-distance saw no massive technological or privacy failures according to interviews with more than two dozen educators parents and students. Just a whole lot of bizarre.“School is back” texted one Fairfax parent. “But it seems in a kind of ‘undead’ version.”There were some hiccups. Just before school launched on Sept. 8 Fairfax which serves 189000 students was hit with a ransomware attack. A group of hackers claimed to have stolen staff information. The incident now being investigated by the FBI did not disrupt online lessons for most students and teachers.Arlington Public Schools struggled with its technology on the first day of learning leaving many of its 28000 students unable to log into class using school-issued devices. Schools Superintendent Francisco Durán attributed the problem to officials’ failure to prepare for the high volume of simultaneous log-ins and the school system resolved the problem — for the most part — by the next day.And in Loudoun County Public Schools which enrolls 83000 some classrooms saw bad behavior. Spokesman Rob Doolittle said teachers in the school system reported racist or sexually inappropriate acts in 10 classrooms spanning six different schools. Officials are still exploring the misconduct and determining appropriate punishment but they are confident that the perpetrators were students.Still bigger issues — such as the lack of Internet and devices that kept thousands from learning last spring — did not surface. School officials throughout Northern Virginia worked all summer to ensure that families could get online in the fall. Staffers delivered iPads Chromebooks and WiFi hotspots; school systems partnered with county governments and service providers to extend Internet to more households.In interviews teachers in the districts said they were thrilled to see almost all of their students pop in to every class.“It’s been incredibly good attendance” said Fairfax’s Bradley who said he missed connecting with just two children. “I think the school did a wonderful job chasing students down.”Danielle Thorne a high school geometry teacher in Alexandria said only three of her students have so far failed to show up — out of 75 she is teaching.“I was nervous about that” Thorne said. “So I’m happily surprised that the kids are all there and they’re all doing their work in class and out of class.”The basics largely taken care of most are confronting the next key question: Can kids actually learn online?Abigail Herrada 16 said she thinks she can — so long as she hides her phone.Herrada who attends high school in Arlington started throwing her iPhone across the room before class began. Then she began stowing it in another room entirely.“In the past you had to sneak your phone into class and you could only be on it for a few minutes” she said. “But now you can be on it the entire class time and the teacher won’t notice so it can be hard to avoid the distractions.”But there are advantages too: Like the fact she can roll straight out of bed throw on a sweatshirt and be at school. She can use the bathroom without having to ask permission. And she can snack anytime she likes — although she makes sure to turn her camera off while she’s eating which she guesses is what counts for courtesy during the coronavirus pandemic.Lorraine Lundqvist a Loudoun parent also said she thinks online school works for her two boys an eighth-grader and a high school senior.Lundqvist who is 52 and works from home running a small consulting company transformed her family’s basement to serve as a virtual classroom. It didn’t take too much: She purchased two stand-or-sit desks from Ikea. Now her boys spend their days learning side-by-side using headphones.Throughout the first week Lundqvist popped downstairs every few hours. She peered in silently then raised a tentative thumbs-up: Are you guys good?“Every time they turned and gave me a thumbs-up back” Lundqvist said. “My kids are engaging with their teachers. They’re learning. I think it’s because the teachers are really really putting a lot of effort forward and the kids are picking up on that.”In fact Lundqvist said she thinks online school might be a boon for her younger son: He had struggled to adjust to middle school disliking the way that other boys shoved each other on the bus or spoke crassly about drugs and girls.“The very first day” Lundqvist said “my youngest son turned to me afterward and said: ‘I love this.’ ”For others though the first week brought an unwelcome realization: that their carefully plotted learn-from-home setups just weren’t going to work.Deanna Caputo 43 has two children enrolled in Arlington schools: a kindergartner and a fourth-grader. She had set them up with learning spaces in their Arlington Forest home but the kindergartner broke down in tears of frustration on her first day. On the fourth day her son suddenly began sobbing.“He just looked at me he didn’t know what to say and he couldn’t explain it” she said. “I asked ‘How are you feeling inside? Are you angry? Are you sad?’ And he was just lonely.”Now her daughter is in a professional pod run by a day-care center which is costing Caputo $1000 a month. And she joined with two other families in her son’s class to create a more informal pod for him which is free.Some educators also had to make adjustments. Thorne the Alexandria teacher said she soon learned that online teaching demands more detailed precise instructions than in-person school did.Elsewhere in Fairfax veteran high school English teacher Theresa Poquis started the week feeling odd and impersonal. How she asked herself could she possibly get to know a screen full of rectangles?Then during the final period on Friday she had an idea.Poquis 52 sent her students into small “breakout rooms” for discussion. When they returned to the main video classroom she sent everyone a link promising it would lead to an instructional slide. Instead the link sent the teenagers to Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” on YouTube — a prank known as “rick-rolling.”“They just started laughing and screaming and saying ‘OMG she just rick-rolled us!’ ‘I can’t believe it!’ ” Poquis said. “They were hysterical.”So was she.

D.C. auditor reviewing fatal shootings by District police,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/dc-auditor-reviewing-fatal-shootings-by-district-police/2020/09/15/c8ffd3b2-f75e-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Kay’s shooting is still under review by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia which has declined to prosecute in the other cases.Families of most of the men killed have objected to the police accounts including relatives of Kay who died when an officer fired at the same time or nearly the same time that the 18-year-old was throwing a gun. His aunt has maintained that Kay was unarmed when the officer pulled the trigger and demonstrators have called for the officer and police chief to be fired.The review is being led by Michael R. Bromwich who served as the court-appointed monitor overseeing a D.C. police memorandum of agreement with the Justice Department in 2001 after officers had shot and killed more people per capita than in any other large city.That memorandum aimed at reducing police use of force expired in 2008. In 2016 the Bromwich Group commissioned by the D.C. auditor conducted a follow-up inquiry and concluded that the number of incidents of excessive force and shootings by officers remained low. “There is no evidence that the [police department] has an excessive use-of-force problem” Bromwich said at the time.In a five-year span in the late 1990s D.C. police fatally shot 57 people with 640 shooting incidents. From 2015 through 2019 D.C. police fatally shot 11 people with 114 shooting incidents. This year police have shot four people Kay being the lone fatality.D.C. Auditor Kathleen Patterson said she initially hoped to have a report from Bromwich in October but it may take longer because of the shooting of Kay.In a statement Patterson said Bromwich will examine the incidents in the context of the memorandum of agreement which prompted vast changes in rules on using force and how investigations are conducted.“It is our hope that this review will contribute constructively to the national and District conversations on policing overall and police use of force” her statement said.Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against officers in the deaths of Carter Young Price and Alston and Kay’s shooting remains under review. The police department which conducts separate internal investigations found that the officers involved in the shootings of Young and Alston acted within department policy. The officer involved in Price’s death was briefly suspended after the crash was ruled “preventable” because the officer failed to stop for a stop sign before entering the intersection.The internal police review involving the death of Kay has not been resolved. D.C. police did not respond to questions on the status of the inquiry in Carter’s case. Police also did not immediately comment on the auditor’s investigation.The chairman of the D.C. police union Gregg Pemberton stressed that most of the cases being reviewed have already undergone scrutiny by federal prosecutors and the police department’s Use of Force Review Board.“It’s almost like city officials are disappointed that the dispositions have not resulted in a finding of police misconduct” Pemberton said Tuesday. “Unfortunately for the anti-police pro-crime advocates our members are well-trained and have acted appropriately in these situations.”He said he is confident that Patterson and Bromwich will reach the same conclusion they did in 2016.The auditor’s review began in July one month before the first meeting of the D.C. Council’s Police Reform Commission made up of 20 people trying to reimagine the future of policing in the District following violent and sometimes deadly encounters involving law enforcement in cities across the country.At an emergency meeting two days after Kay was killed members of the newly formed commission demanded police release body-camera video from all of the officers at the scene and called for an independent investigation into the shooting. The department complying with a new D.C. Council law made public only the video from the officer who fired.Members said they wanted to see additional perspectives of the shooting and city leaders who attended the meeting agreed to seek advice from legal counsel and perhaps let the commission view additional videos in private.But at the commission’s meeting Monday members learned that questions about additional videos and others regarding the shooting would be delivered to Patterson whose office would make the inquiries of police.That frustrated some members. Mignon Smith a former school principal said the commission was promised an answer only to learn now that the questions have been “turned over to the hands of someone else.”The group’s co-chair Christy Lopez director of the Innovative Policing Program at Georgetown Law who led Justice Department investigations of police abuse in Ferguson Mo. said the commission had requested an independent review into Kay’s death and that is what the D.C. auditor is doing.Lopez said the commission is trying to look into broader issues of police conduct and practices alternatives to sending officers to certain calls whether police should be in schools restorative justice issues and discipline.The alternative Lopez said is “we spend all of our time on this one very important incident and we don’t get at the root of the underlying issues that we all want to get to to prevent similar incidents.”,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/dc-auditor-reviewing-fatal-shootings-by-district-police/2020/09/15/c8ffd3b2-f75e-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Tadka — a spice-infused oil or ghee — can take any salad from ho-hum to flavorful,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/09/09/tadka-a-spice-infused-oil-or-ghee-can-take-any-salad-from-ho-hum-to-flavorful/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Overview Ingredients Steps Overview Salads may not immediately come to mind when Indian food is mentioned. Spice-rich ingredient-heavy multistep dishes such as chicken tikka masala samosas biryani more often symbolize the cuisine. [No two bites are the same in this soft juicy and crunchy tomato salad] A variety of salads however are savored throughout India. They differ in style and flavor from region to region and table to table and usually perform in the background as a crunchy sidekick — an obligatory part of a spread or a palate-changing contrast to a meaty dish. Perhaps the most common Indian salad in the United States is raita which is popular in northern and western India. It is made with diced cucumbers onions or tomatoes mixed with yogurt and spiced with cumin or mustard powder and garnished with chopped mint or cilantro. That yogurt-based salad fits into one of the broad categories of Indian salads which also include cooked oil-free and tadka-based. Like India itself with its inexplicable unity among head-exploding diversity these varied salads often intersect and overlap. For me the most intriguing of the lot is a tadka-based salad. [The best summer tomato salads use just a few ingredients to generate big flavors] Tadka also known as chaaunk vaghaar bagar phodni popu thaalippu is a cooking technique so omnipresent in India that most kitchens have a special pot reserved exclusively for it. Tadka is oil or ghee drunk on spices. Zapping spices such as black mustard or cumin seeds in hot fat is the perfect way to extricate — or bloom — flavors. Turmeric is a common addition to the tadka giving a golden gloss to the dish. Tadka may be the first step of a dish — or the last one. And in some states in the south and west — including Maharashtra where I come from — tadka is commonly repurposed as a dressing for diced vegetables. Like others from west India I prefer to use a neutral oil such as peanut or vegetable for tadka preferring a blank canvas for the spices. North and east Indians are partial to mustard oil for their tadka. To start your tadka heat the oil in a small heavy-bottomed pot. To test if the oil is hot enough add a seed or two. If the seeds start sizzling the instant they hit the oil the temperature is just right. As the oil heats the seeds will start to pop. Once they stop dancing the oil is cumin-y mustardy and is ready to inject these flavors and hues into anything that follows including a sabji a dal or a fresh salad. In my mother tongue Marathi salad is called koshimbir. Cucumbers tomatoes onions and red pumpkin are popular koshimbir ingredients but I have seen nontraditional choices such as guava and apple too. The diced vegetables get an enriching boost from roasted peanut powder that imparts creaminess as well as a protein punch. On top of all this goes the scorching tadka. The aroma and sizzle unleashed by tadka as it hits the vegetables is a heady sensory experience and a harbinger of the contentment to follow. Tadka magnifies the oomph bestows richness tames the grassiness of greens and subdues vegetables until they realize who is the boss and start giving up soppy slurpy juices. [Staff picks: 8 condiments we swear by and how to use them] Until I came to the United States more than 20 years ago I didn’t know that salad dressings existed as a category or that salads were commonly eaten as a main course. That has changed. Below you will find one of my favorite salads — a lunch-worthy tadka-based meal that is bulked up thanks to sprouted mung beans. I continue to experiment because you can dress any salad with tadka. A grain or bean salad would each take to tadka particularly well. And go to town with spices: Mustard seeds cumin seeds coriander nigella caraway black peppers cinnamon star anise cloves. Garlic pieces and chile peppers both fresh green and dry red can add a satiating kick. Whether you make it for salad or not tadka with its flavor-enhancing tiny-but-mighty powers is adaptable letting you tailor spices to suit your cravings in a variety of recipes and cuisines.

Ingredients FOR THE SALAD 1 cup (4 1/2 ounces) medium-diced cucumber 1 cup (4 1/2 ounces) medium-diced Roma tomatoes 1 cup (2 ounces) coarsely grated carrot about 1 medium 1 cup (3 1/2 ounces) finely chopped green or napa cabbage 1 cup (4 ounces) sprouted mung beans (see NOTE) 1/4 cup roasted peanut powder (see NOTE) 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1/8 teaspoon ground red chile (optional) 3 teaspoons fresh lime juice 1/2 teaspoon table salt or 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro for garnish FOR THE TADKA 2 tablespoons vegetable oil or another neutral oil 1/4 teaspoon black or yellow mustard seeds 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric Steps Step 1 Make the salad: In a large bowl toss together the cucumber tomatoes carrot cabbage mung beans peanut powder cumin chile (if using) lime juice and salt until combined. Set aside or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Step 2 Make the tadka: When ready to serve in a small heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat add the oil and heat until shimmering. Drop a mustard seed in the oil; if it starts to pop and crackle immediately the oil is ready. If not wait and repeat until one does. Add the remaining mustard seeds the cumin seeds and turmeric then turn the heat off. Be careful as the seeds can land on you while they are “dancing” and burn the skin. Step 3 Once the seeds stop popping pour the tadka over the salad and gently toss to combine. Garnish with cilantro gently toss again and serve. NOTESTo make peanut powder: Put a rack in the center position of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Spread 1/2 cup raw shelled unsalted peanuts on a medium rimmed baking sheet. Toast for 5 to 6 minutes rotating the sheet from front to back halfway through until the peanuts are dark brown. Transfer the peanuts to a food processor or coffee grinder and grind them to a coarse powder. Storage: If you make additional peanut powder refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. If using salted store-bought roasted peanuts adjust the salt in the recipe. Ready-made peanut powder is available at international markets and online. To make sprouted mung beans: To get 1 cup of sprouted beans soak 1/4 cup (2 ounces) of whole green mung beans in 2 cups of water for at least 6 hours and up to overnight. The beans should sink. Skim off and discard any that are still floating then drain and spread the rest on a flat plate. Transfer the beans to a wet cheesecloth twist the ends together into a loose knot and set it twisted end down in a colander over a large bowl or tray. Let sit on the counter for 24 hours checking every few hours to ensure the cheesecloth remains moist remoistening as needed. After 24 hours your sprouts should be about 1-inch long. Rinse the sprouts under running water and use in salads soups stir-fries or wraps. Consider sprouting other beans such as brown lentils black garbanzo beans and moth beans. Sprouting jars available online make sprouting easy. Keep in mind: Warm weather will hasten the sprouting. Recipe from food writer Annada D. Rathi.

I watch a lot of TMZ and MSNBC and anything else that starts with a letter. But all jokes aside the reality is we are looking a little further out than what’s happening right now. There’s two ways of looking at it. We can all lament as to where we are now or we can focus on how do we envision a recovery. We look at where the American people are: They’re ready to get on the road they’re ready to travel. They’re sick and tired of being told what they can’t do. And although this is not the time to not pay attention to the protocol of wearing a mask and being safe there are going to be opportunities for us to be able to attract those visitors to Washington be it because we have so many free things to do and when individuals’ economic status might have changed they’re looking at getting out but how do they get out at a discount. They’re recognizing the fact that right now; hotel room rates are very favorable because everyone’s going after the same visitor. And how do we attract the drive-in market — the 50 million people that live within four hours of Washington D.C. — to opt to come to Washington because there’s not going to be a lot of consumer confidence about getting on a plane. People are going to say: “We want to go somewhere we want to do something. Let’s go to Washington. They’ve got all these amazing free things to do. Hotel rooms are going to be at a discount because of the recovery efforts. And now more than ever we can really probably get some great deals.”You’re looking into the future. For those of us stuck in what we might think is a depressing present is the future you see a happy one?We're already seeing people coming to the city. We're seeing an increase of calls of people wanting to ask what's open now.You are one of relatively few Black men to have reached your pinnacle in the travel and hospitality industry. Can you talk about why that might be and what that’s been like for you?There are over 700 destination management organizations and there are less than 10 that are [run by] Black males and females. We’ve been dealing with and tackling the issue of the lack of diversity within this industry the lack of opportunities and then digging in a little deeper and really dealing with the Black Lives Matter movement.You tell a story of having received an award at an industry event and either before or after you were on the podium someone assumed you were a waiter.The reason why we tell those stories is because it’s very difficult for the White community to understand the impact and implications of a murder such as George Floyd. Because the perception is George Floyd is a bad guy because he [allegedly] tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill and this is what happens when you do bad things. And the other part of that is to recognize the fact that you see me in a suit and tie or a tuxedo or whatever and you say “Yeah he’s one of the Black guys who has done well.” You know all the things I have heard: “credit to his race” “speaks well” “he’s not like the rest.” But no matter how poorly you articulate how you perceive me as a Black person if you see me walking down your street at night the same Elliott and you don’t know it’s me you’re just going to automatically go into this place that we’ve seen time and time again. I could be a George Floyd. I’m just a Black guy who is going to face some inappropriate level of force that as a White person you probably will never have to deal with. These are the conversations we’re having so that White people won’t automatically make these assumptions that bad things happen to bad people. No that’s not true. And if you’re Black it’s even worse.You’ve said that leaning into this moment is not simply an issue of diversity and inclusion that we need to talk about slavery and Jim Crow and systemic racism because those are not simply issues from the past. Why is it important to insist that these things aren’t passed? Yes slavery has been over theoretically for 155 years. But what happened after that and what are the residual effects of what happened after that? Jim Crow segregation may have happened in most people's opinions years ago which it happened technically in my lifetime but the residual effects the redlining in terms of how economic opportunities existed for the Black community and Black districts still happen today. The fact that the school systems in the Black community receive less funding and therefore you did not have the same educational opportunities. And from an institutional perspective institutional wealth in the Black community is nonexistent because the first generation that arguably could really get a college education and that was not easy would be my parents my mom born in 1945. And even of that generation not even 50 percent actually were able to get college educations. So the question is: How do all these things play a role? And I think that if I get folks to understand namely the White community to understand how and why that still plays a role — you know I'm not expecting you to say "Hey I'm sorry that my great-great-grandfather was a racist." Just recognize these things have conversations about them and do better.Are you heartened by the movement that is rising up now and trying to force these conversations? This is not the first time you saw Black White and other races coming together to march on racial inequality and injustice. What’s happening that’s different this time is that at the end of the day it all boils down to corporate America. Well it boils down to more than that; it boils down to mind-set and other things. But when you see that corporate America is taking responsibility and looking at these things — [saying] we’ve got to do better and make changes — that’s a good sign. Because at the end of the day politically speaking or not it’s all about economics. We need to hold corporate America accountable. And they won’t be held accountable if we don’t have people in place that make this a priority and if folks like myself get to places like I am now professionally if I’m not willing to speak up more and be more vocal.This interview has been edited and condensed.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/the-head-of-dc-tourism-group-reflects-on-being-one-of-the-few-black-men-at-the-top-of-the-industry/2020/09/14/608b5bfc-e09e-11ea-b69b-64f7b0477ed4_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
With no contact and substantial space, Getaway’s tiny houses were ahead of their time,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/with-no-contact-and-substantial-space-getaways-tiny-houses-were-ahead-of-their-time/2020/09/10/975276f8-efc0-11ea-ab4e-581edb849379_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“Getaway is naturally about socially distancing” said Jon Staff who founded the company with his Harvard pal Pete Davis. “No part of the business was about hanging out with other people.”The mod cabins are built for our current reality even though they date from a simpler time: 2015. Staff and Davis who has since left the company created the retreat for overworked urbanites tethered to technology. Turns out the pro-nature anti-social model is a perfect fit for a global health crisis too.While hotels struggle to recover — occupancy rates are still under 50 percent — Getaway is thriving. The company which operates the cabins at 12 locations in nine states reported a 99 percent occupancy rate in July and August and a 260 percent spike in bookings from May through July. Most of the outposts are more than 90 percent full through October; the Shenandoah Valley property where I recently stayed is at 99.8 percent.The Getaway colonies are no more than a two-hour drive from such major urban centers as D.C. New York Dallas and Los Angeles — a common round-trip commute for many city folk. Each property contains about 30 to 50 structures on double-digit acres of sylvan land. The company plans to open No. 13 in New York’s Adirondacks by the end of this year as well as expand some outposts. For example the Virginia property will unveil nine two-person cabins and two four-person accommodations on Dec. 21.“Quiet time in nature should be part of a wellness routine like meditation or yoga” Staff told me after my visit. “If you’re stressed out you should be able to pull a rip cord and be sitting at a campfire.”To be sure dropping out and into nature is not a novel concept. Take Henry David Thoreau whose transcendent ruminations sit on every Getaway bookshelf. The Virginia property is near Shenandoah National Park where Depression-era President Herbert Hoover escaped the stress of the White House at his Brown House. The park rents cabins though many are not as isolated or self-sufficient as the tiny houses. My cabin at Skyland resort shared a wall with strangers and with no cooking facilities I had to venture out for meals. I also had to wait in several lines: to pick up and drop off my key report the leaky sink and order my free cup of coffee consolation for the resort’s decision to remove the coffee makers.The Getaway in Stanardsville Va. is only 100 miles from D.C. but my journey there took several months. I first booked two nights for late March at the pre-inflation price of $99 a night which included a free future night’s stay. (I am wistful for before-the-virus deals. You’ll see why in a few sentences.) Weeks before my trip I had to cancel because of the emerging health crisis. Months later I tried again. In early July I checked the booking calendar and found one available date at the end of the month. I pounced on it but someone with quicker mouse reflexes grabbed it. I looked at August and saw one opening on a Thursday night. I nabbed the house paying $341 for one human and one dog. (When I asked Staff about the price increase he said the company was capping rates at $299. I reminded him about the taxes which push the price into the mid-$300s.)Check-in time is a firm 3 p.m. The company texts the cabin name and code to unlock the door no more than a half-hour beforehand. (I received my details at 2:36 p.m.) The staff asks guests to not enter any earlier in accordance with their stringent cleaning process. They did however send me a map of the Getaway neighborhood in advance so I could find my cabin and learn the names of my neighbors. I was staying in Hank and my neighbors were Felix Lenore Caroll Shirley and Forrest. The structures are named after the grandparents of employees and special guests; Hank is the granddad of one of the cabin builders.The 34 houses resembled upscale trailers for Keebler elves. They were bark-brown and rectangular with two wheels anchored to the earth. In the side yard a picnic table and Adirondack chairs formed a crescent around a fire pit. A bin labeled “campfire kit” contained bundles of logs and kindling which cost $6.50 and $2 respectively. To ensure privacy the company placed the fire pits away from neighbors’ prying eyes. From my seat by the fire I could not see Felix’s blaze and I imagine the reverse held true for Hank.Inside eastern white pine covered nearly every inch of the 142-square-foot space; I felt as if I were inside the hollow of a tree. The layout is intuitive and ingenious a jigsaw puzzle of architectural design: There’s a bathroom with a toilet and shower; a kitchen with a two-burner stove mini-fridge and sink (for teeth-brushing and dishwashing); a table and chair; and up a few steps a queen-size bed dressed in crisp white linens. The entire wall by the bed is consumed by a picture window framing a not-so-still life of the forest.I brought my own food but didn’t need to. A pantry drawer came stocked with rustic-gourmand provisions including Amy’s tomato soup a pound of Allegra penne rigate Bob’s Red Mill organic oatmeal mao feng green tea bags by Teapigs and Kuju coffee pods. Prices ranged from 50 cents (hot chocolate) to $7.50 (pasta sauce) hardly the minibar markup of traditional hotel rooms. As a welcome gift the staff left me a s’mores kit and for Siena dog treats with the same flavor profile.Since the pandemic some members of the hospitality industry have been pitching their accommodations as an office-away-from-home. Getaway is proposing the opposite: “This is a sacred place where you do no work” Staff said. To remove any temptations the cabins do not come with WiFi and a lockbox encourages guests to stash their gadgets for their stay. (Those without discipline might need a vault with a closure stronger than a clasp. Maybe a lock controlled by Oz-like staff?) For music I streamed tunes from the old-fashioned radio.Siena and I set out to explore the 80-acre property an uncluttered setting with a few winding roads and groves of trees. I saw guests at ease: two boys swinging in a hammock a dad roasting hot dogs for his daughter a Siberian husky sitting as still as a garden gnome. I glanced but didn’t engage. We jagged left to a network of interlocking nature trails. We ran into a couple with their dog. “This is like King’s Dominion for the pups” the owner remarked from the opposite side of the creek as the dogs sniffed their approval. On our way back to our cabin I noticed a man on a cellphone but the loud chatter of insects drowned him out.Back at the house Siena climbed into bed and I considered activities amenable to self-isolation and tech-deprivation. “We encourage you to not do very much” Staff said. “Be inside your cabin. Be outside your cabin. Do nothing at all.”I perused the little library selected “Getting Away” by the Getaway co-founder and told Siena to make some room. The book came out in June but Staff clearly wrote it before the pandemic. In the introduction he addresses the perils of another era: “The digital age has left us unbalanced.” He recommends 75 ways to regain your equilibrium advice that is as relevant today as it was in February. I started with the section titled “Balance Yourself.” He suggested writing in a gratitude journal meditating for five minutes a day and turning off your push notifications. Before I knew it I was practicing Lesson No. 4: sleep.In the morning I received a text apologizing for being the bearer of bad news: We would have to vacate by 11 a.m. Hank needed to get ready for the next group of guests who might be seeking balance or maybe just a good long snooze in the forest.Where to stay2010 Madison Rd. Stanardsville Va.The tiny houses are open ­year-round and come with a private bathroom with a hot shower full kitchen and fire pit (wood costs extra). Bring your food or raid the pantry which offers such staples as pasta soup oatmeal coffee tea and beef jerky for a charge. No WiFi though at the Virginia property my cellphone service was strong. (In the event of a bad connection each cabin comes with a red phone.) Rates range from $199 to $299 depending on the season.

Hotel rooms are going to be at a discount because of the recovery efforts. And now more than ever we can really probably get some great deals.”You’re looking into the future. For those of us stuck in what we might think is a depressing present is the future you see a happy one?We're already seeing people coming to the city. We're seeing an increase of calls of people wanting to ask what's open now.You are one of relatively few Black men to have reached your pinnacle in the travel and hospitality industry. Can you talk about why that might be and what that’s been like for you?There are over 700 destination management organizations and there are less than 10 that are [run by] Black males and females. We’ve been dealing with and tackling the issue of the lack of diversity within this industry the lack of opportunities and then digging in a little deeper and really dealing with the Black Lives Matter movement.You tell a story of having received an award at an industry event and either before or after you were on the podium someone assumed you were a waiter.The reason why we tell those stories is because it’s very difficult for the White community to understand the impact and implications of a murder such as George Floyd. Because the perception is George Floyd is a bad guy because he [allegedly] tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill and this is what happens when you do bad things. And the other part of that is to recognize the fact that you see me in a suit and tie or a tuxedo or whatever and you say “Yeah he’s one of the Black guys who has done well.” You know all the things I have heard: “credit to his race” “speaks well” “he’s not like the rest.” But no matter how poorly you articulate how you perceive me as a Black person if you see me walking down your street at night the same Elliott and you don’t know it’s me you’re just going to automatically go into this place that we’ve seen time and time again. I could be a George Floyd. I’m just a Black guy who is going to face some inappropriate level of force that as a White person you probably will never have to deal with. These are the conversations we’re having so that White people won’t automatically make these assumptions that bad things happen to bad people. No that’s not true. And if you’re Black it’s even worse.You’ve said that leaning into this moment is not simply an issue of diversity and inclusion that we need to talk about slavery and Jim Crow and systemic racism because those are not simply issues from the past. Why is it important to insist that these things aren’t passed? Yes slavery has been over theoretically for 155 years. But what happened after that and what are the residual effects of what happened after that? Jim Crow segregation may have happened in most people's opinions years ago which it happened technically in my lifetime but the residual effects the redlining in terms of how economic opportunities existed for the Black community and Black districts still happen today. The fact that the school systems in the Black community receive less funding and therefore you did not have the same educational opportunities. And from an institutional perspective institutional wealth in the Black community is nonexistent because the first generation that arguably could really get a college education and that was not easy would be my parents my mom born in 1945. And even of that generation not even 50 percent actually were able to get college educations. So the question is: How do all these things play a role? And I think that if I get folks to understand namely the White community to understand how and why that still plays a role — you know I'm not expecting you to say "Hey I'm sorry that my great-great-grandfather was a racist." Just recognize these things have conversations about them and do better.Are you heartened by the movement that is rising up now and trying to force these conversations? This is not the first time you saw Black White and other races coming together to march on racial inequality and injustice. What’s happening that’s different this time is that at the end of the day it all boils down to corporate America. Well it boils down to more than that; it boils down to mind-set and other things. But when you see that corporate America is taking responsibility and looking at these things — [saying] we’ve got to do better and make changes — that’s a good sign. Because at the end of the day politically speaking or not it’s all about economics. We need to hold corporate America accountable. And they won’t be held accountable if we don’t have people in place that make this a priority and if folks like myself get to places like I am now professionally if I’m not willing to speak up more and be more vocal.This interview has been edited and condensed.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/the-head-of-dc-tourism-group-reflects-on-being-one-of-the-few-black-men-at-the-top-of-the-industry/2020/09/14/608b5bfc-e09e-11ea-b69b-64f7b0477ed4_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

I watch a lot of TMZ and MSNBC and anything else that starts with a letter. But all jokes aside the reality is we are looking a little further out than what’s happening right now. There’s two ways of looking at it. We can all lament as to where we are now or we can focus on how do we envision a recovery. We look at where the American people are: They’re ready to get on the road they’re ready to travel. They’re sick and tired of being told what they can’t do. And although this is not the time to not pay attention to the protocol of wearing a mask and being safe there are going to be opportunities for us to be able to attract those visitors to Washington be it because we have so many free things to do and when individuals’ economic status might have changed they’re looking at getting out but how do they get out at a discount. They’re recognizing the fact that right now; hotel room rates are very favorable because everyone’s going after the same visitor. And how do we attract the drive-in market — the 50 million people that live within four hours of Washington D.C. — to opt to come to Washington because there’s not going to be a lot of consumer confidence about getting on a plane.

Embracing quinoa’s nutty flavor is the key to unlocking its potential,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/09/14/embracing-quinoas-nutty-flavor-is-the-key-to-unlocking-its-potential/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Overview Ingredients Steps Overview I have struggled to understand America’s love affair with quinoa. Sure it’s packed with protein about eight grams per cup and it’s quick-cooking which is always a bonus. But the flavor? I find it dusty and dull a far cry from the floral overtones of say jasmine rice. It also may as well be recommended by dentists because flossing is a must after a meal of quinoa. Still after years of ignoring quinoa in favor of other grains I couldn’t quit the compunction that I hadn’t done enough to Give Quinoa A Chance. Forcing myself to cook and eat quinoa was a chore. I slogged through books recipes and YouTube videos that inevitably had the word “healthy” in the title because apparently that’s a quinoa buzzword — flavor is never mentioned. But in the end all it took was a different descriptive word to help me turn the corner and finally embrace this tiny seed. [Start your grain bowl right with these 5 jazzy rice recipes] Quinoa is a surprisingly beautiful plant. It grows well in northern California nestled among the redwood trees and cannabis acreage where the fir-lined roads of Humboldt County are dotted with billboards advertising local quinoa farms. Waving fields of 6-foot-tall quinoa stalks topped with multicolored plumes of seeds made me long for a way to make quinoa taste as lovely as it looks. In quinoa’s native Peru it’s typically served as a topping on rice — which might sound like overkill to the carb-conscious until they understand that quinoa is a member of the amaranth family a pseudocereal meaning it’s a plant that looks and acts like a grain but like millet and buckwheat isn’t actually one. [These quinoa salad recipes will help you make the ideal summer grain bowl] I adore amaranth. I practically inhaled the malty amaranth cookies of my hippie childhood. So when I turned to Karen Page’s comprehensive reference book “The Vegetarian Flavor Bible” amaranth became the starting point of my quest to understand what other ingredients might quell — or complement — quinoa’s earthiness. Amaranth is slightly sweeter than quinoa (some folks say black quinoa is sweeter than white or red quinoa) and many ingredients work well with both from black beans and garlic to spinach and tomatoes. Those flavor combinations are a great place to begin but quinoa still becomes the afterthought barely a supporting player on the plate. The other descriptive word associated with quinoa that kept coming up was “nutty.” The more I read that descriptor the more I started thinking about the taste and texture of raw nuts such as almonds and walnuts. To me they also taste dusty but in a more pleasing way. Bingo. Nuts are an ingredient I understand — and like. So once I started pairing quinoa with flavors I might pair with nuts I hit my stride. Quinoa with basil? Yes! Quinoa with spicy chiles? Heck yeah! Quinoa with coconut? A gift from the heavens. Quinoa’s not just a thing to fill your belly an additive for a healthy grain bowl or an afterthought in a granola bar — it’s an ingredient that deserves to be cooked with respect. Only then can quinoa come into its own. Case in point: Swapping out water for coconut milk results in plump tender quinoa. Toss in a couple of fresh chiles for an undertone of heat boosted by the fat from the coconut milk. Top it with your protein of choice and a punchy tomato-chile condiment and you have a flavorful and fiber-rich twist on a Laotian dish that’s typically served with coconut sticky rice. Substituting different liquids for the cooking water is a simple way to bring out quinoa’s best qualities. Red quinoa cooked in red wine takes on an almost smoky quality that pairs beautifully with charred lemons fried in peppery olive oil while cooking quinoa in a broth made from shrimp shells and fresh lime peel can take a shrimp-topped grain bowl to the next level. In some dishes such as shrimp and cashews a classic combo in Malaysian cooking quinoa can simply take over the nuts’ role. And don’t forget about herbs and spices. A quinoa version of khichidi redolent with turmeric and fresh ginger is complemented by the texture of fried cumin seeds. Blending cooked quinoa into pesto instead of pine nuts adds flavor and body. Cook quinoa in orange juice and chill it overnight with chocolate almond milk for a richly flavorful pudding. Turns out I do like quinoa now. Treated as a substantial ingredient quinoa brings more to the plate than just protein and fiber. So go ahead and give it some love. Green Curry-Coconut Quinoa With Tofu and Chile-Garlic Sauce The quinoa is accompanied by crispy seared tofu but chicken beef or fish will work just as well. Scale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here. Ingredients Two 13.5-ounce cans full fat coconut milk Kosher salt 2 cups (13 1/2 ounces) white quinoa 1 fresh red Thai chile slit down the middle on one side (may substitute jalapeño or habanero chile) 2 tablespoons Thai green curry paste One (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu 2 tablespoons vegetable or another neutral oil Freshly ground white pepper (may substitute black pepper) 1/2 cup Jeow Marg Len or your favorite chile-garlic sauce such as sambal oelek 1/4 cup (1 ounce) roasted salted peanuts roughly chopped Lime wedges for serving Fresh cilantro for serving Steps Step 1 Make the quinoa: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat combine the coconut milk and a generous pinch of salt and bring to a lively simmer. Stir in the quinoa and chile. Reduce the heat to low cover and simmer gently stirring midway through to prevent scorching on the bottom until the quinoa is slightly sticky and toothsome and the coconut milk is mostly absorbed 15 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit covered for another 5 minutes. Stir in the curry paste and set aside. Step 2 Make the seared tofu: Pat the tofu dry with towels then slice across into 8 equal pieces. Pat each piece dry. In a large skillet over medium-high heat heat 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering. Add the tofu and sear until golden and crisp along the edges 4 to 5 minutes. Turn over and sear on the other side until golden and crisp 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the tofu pieces to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately season lightly with salt and pepper. Step 3 To serve pile the quinoa on a large serving platter then top with the seared tofu and spoon the jeow marg len or chile-garlic sauce over the top. Garnish with the peanuts lime wedges and cilantro and serve right away. Recipe from food writer Kristen Hartke. Tested by Olga Massov; email questions to voraciously@washpost.com.

Start Rosh Hashanah on a sweet note with tishpishti, an orange-scented semolina cake,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/09/11/start-rosh-hashanah-on-a-sweet-note-with-tishpishti-an-orange-scented-semolina-cake/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Overview Ingredients Steps Overview When it comes to Rosh Hashanah desserts apple cake or honey cake might sound most familiar to Ashkenazi (Eastern and Central European) Jews celebrating the Jewish New Year. But the Jewish diaspora is as wide as its global recipe box which boasts other sweet delights such as this fine and worthy option: a syrup-soaked semolina cake known as tishpishti. [Make your greatest High Holidays meal yet with these Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur recipes] Tishpishti originated in Turkey and is popular across Sephardi Middle Eastern and North African Jewish communities. The name is a nonsense word stemming from Turkish and translating roughly as “quickly done.” According to Gil Marks’s “The Encyclopedia of Jewish Food” tishpishti is “a traditional Rosh Hashanah dessert served to start the new year on a sweet note.” In other words the symbolism of tishpishti is similar to apple or honey cake except the popular semolina cake is generously bathed in fragrant syrup. The combination of semolina and syrup gives tishpishti the delightful nubbiness of cornbread and the thick spoonable texture of polenta. The ingredient list for syrupy semolina cakes varies significantly depending on where it is being baked. The name also changes accordingly and is regionally called basbousa revani safra hareesa or namoura. Some cakes contain finely ground semolina only while others also include all-purpose flour nut flour or dried coconut. Some households bake an all nut flour version of the cake particularly around Passover when wheat-based semolina is verboten. Tishpishti is also served at other festive occasions throughout the year. Some families mark the end of Yom Kippur’s fast with a piece of cake. Others serve it on Purim or as a treat for Shabbat. My favorite recipes for tishpishti are those enriched with butter and yogurt which impart a richness and subtle tang to offset the syrup’s unabashed sweetness. But versions of the cake served in observant Jewish homes are typically lightened with beaten egg whites or moistened with orange juice and oil to keep the batter dairy-free (and therefore suitable for dessert after a kosher meal containing meat). The top of the cake is often decorated with whole or chopped pistachios or almonds or a sprinkle of dried coconut. And the syrup made with either sugar honey or a mixture of both is rarely left plain. Instead it comes lavishly perfumed with rose water orange blossom water cinnamon or citrus zest. “The syrup used in my family is flavored with lemon or orange peel and orange juice” said Rabbi Ute Steyer who grew up in Athens and now lives in Stockholm. “It really adds to the flavor but my family is a bit obsessive about adding lemon and orange to everything!” When it comes to semolina cakes just about anything goes. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t rules the most important of which is to pour the room-temperature syrup slowly and steadily over the warm cake letting it absorb without flooding the top. (Pour-over coffee aficionados will be familiar with the light touch required by the syrup-drizzling hand.) Another rule is to let the cake fully cool before slicing — again for maximum syrup absorption. When the cake is ready to serve it can be sliced into small squares or diamonds and served with more syrup for drizzling and a glass of fresh mint tea alongside. A dusting of confectioner’s sugar or a billowy cloud of freshly whipped cream gilds the lily while a dollop of yogurt transforms any leftovers (which keep for several days thanks to the syrup) into an enviable breakfast. “There’s a serious machloket (dispute) over which parts are the best the middle sections or the corners with a bit of crust” Steyer said. “I still can’t decide so I take two pieces just to make sure!” Tishpishti (Citrus Semolina Cake) Those who prefer a dairy-free cake can substitute high-quality vegan butter and unsweetened coconut yogurt. Storage: The syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Where to buy: Orange blossom water can be found at Middle Eastern markets or online. Ingredients FOR THE SYRUP 1 cup (240 milliliters) water 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) fresh orange juice 1 teaspoon orange blossom water (optional) FOR THE CAKE 1 cup (240 milliliters) full-fat plain yogurt (may substitute unsweetened coconut yogurt) 3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar 1/2 cup (1 stick/115 grams) unsalted butter melted and slightly cooled (may substitute vegan butter) 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) fresh orange juice 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest 2 cups (360 grams) fine semolina 1/3 cup (15 grams) finely shredded unsweetened dried coconut 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Confectioners’ sugar for serving Finely chopped toasted pistachios for serving Steps Step 1 Make the syrup: In a small saucepan combine the water and sugar and set over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil stirring to dissolve the sugar. Decrease the heat to medium and simmer stirring occasionally until the syrup thickens slightly 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the orange juice and orange blossom water if using. Let cool completely. Step 2 Make the cake: Position a baking rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Cut two long rectangles of parchment paper and line a 9-inch round cake pan with it criss-crossing in the middle ensuring there is generous overhang on all 4 sides. In a large bowl whisk together the yogurt sugar butter orange juice and zest until well combined. Step 3 In a medium bowl whisk together the semolina coconut baking powder and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and gently fold together until fully incorporated. Transfer the batter to the parchment-lined pan smooth the top over with an offset spatula and let the batter stand for about 5 minutes to let the semolina absorb some of the liquid. Step 4 Place the cake pan in the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes until set and lightly golden around the edges (a toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean). Step 5 Transfer the cake to a wire rack and let cool for a few minutes. Using a fork or a skewer poke holes across the surface of the cake. While the cake is still hot slowly drizzle 1 cup (240 milliliters) syrup evenly over the top. Let stand for about 5 minutes then drizzle another 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) syrup. (Reserve the remaining syrup for serving.) Let the cake cool to room temperature then grasp the parchment overhang and gently lift the cake out of the pan and transfer it to a serving plate.

This is a story all about how you can rent a room in the ‘Fresh Prince’ mansion,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/09/14/fresh-prince-mansion-will-smith-airbnb/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Perhaps to take our minds off the nightmare year we’re living in Airbnb has been reviving relics of the 1990s this summer. First it put the world’s last Blockbuster up for rent. Now it’s offering a bedroom in the "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” mansion in Los Angeles. Coinciding with the sitcom’s 30th anniversary Will Smith himself listed a room in the fictional Banks’s family mansion on Airbnb for $30 per night. It will be up for grabs starting Sept. 29 at 11 a.m. Pacific time. Bookings for a night of nostalgia are extremely limited. “Will’s wing” of the mansion only will be available to Los Angeles County residents for five one-night stays: Oct. 2 Oct. 5 Oct. 8 Oct. 11 and Oct. 14. [State Dept. lifts ‘do not travel’ advisory for Mexico as border closure is due to expire] The mansion — not technically in Bel-Air but in nearby Brentwood — has come a long way since the Philadelphia transplant moved in back in 1990. Today guests can take advantage of the mansion’s pool and surrounding lounge chairs graffiti art Will’s closet a turntable as well as Philly cheesesteaks served on silver platters. Guests will also be greeted virtually by DJ Jazzy Jeff. Up to two people can stay in the bedroom in "Will's wing" of the mansion. (Airbnb) The Banks family won’t be on site to lay down the law but you’re staying under their roof and following their rules. For example pets aren’t allowed and only two people can stay at the mansion per booking. “While I love a good soirée friends cannot stop by during your stay” Smith says in his listing. “While my uncle has a strict ‘no parties’ policy; don’t forget to have fun!” The "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" mansion will be open for bookings starting Sept. 29. (Airbnb) Because we’re still in a pandemic there are coronavirus-specific rules too. “While the city of Los Angeles is allowing travel out of an abundance of caution all guests who request to book must be Los Angeles County residents and currently live in the same household to minimize COVID-19 risk” the listing says. “Prior to your arrival all guests must confirm they have not traveled outside of California within the past 14 days have not had recent exposure to people known to be diagnosed with COVID-19 and do not have a fever of 100.4F or more a cough or shortness of breath.” Guests must also provide a negative coronavirus test dated within 72 hours of their stay and wear a face mask during check-in and check-out. And for those who can’t get a stay at the mansion there’s an Airbnb Online Experience with DJ Jazzy Jeff taking place on Oct. 1 in which fans can learn how to spin and scratch records.

State Dept. lifts ‘do not travel’ advisory for Mexico as border closure is due to expire,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/09/14/mexico-border-travel-advisory/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
The U.S. State Department has lowered its travel advisory for Mexico to a Level 3 from its highest possible Level 4 days before the U.S.-Mexico border closure is due to expire on Sept. 21. The modified travel advisory says U.S. travelers should “reconsider travel to Mexico due to covid-19” as well as “crime and kidnapping.” A border closure restricting nonessential travel has been in place between the United States and Mexico since March 21 in an effort to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus according to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico. The border closure terms only apply to land and water crossings as flights between the United States and Mexico have largely continued since the early days of the pandemic. Until last week the State Department’s Mexico advisory was a Level 4 (do not travel) nationwide. Some less-visited regions of Mexico remain classified Level 4 for “crime and kidnapping.” The popular resort areas of Cabo San Lucas Cancún and Cozumel have been allowing U.S. travelers who fly into the country to visit without required quarantines or coronavirus tests. Instead Mexican airports have been carrying out health-screening procedures such as temperature checks according to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico. “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice for Mexico due to COVID-19” the advisory states. “Mexico has lifted stay at home orders in some areas and resumed some transportation and business operations. Visit the Embassy’s COVID-19 page for more information on COVID-19 in Mexico.” Mexico has seen a total of 668000 coronavirus cases and more than 70000 deaths according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University with daily new cases peaking in August before lowering and holding steady in the range of 4000 to 6000 per day since then. The United States has reported more than 6 million total coronavirus cases and 190000 deaths with the peak in daily new cases hitting mid-July at more than 75000. The change comes soon after some major tourist sites in Mexico reopened including Teotihuacán a UNESCO World Heritage Site outside of Mexico City. The only area in Mexico that has a higher covid-19 rate than Mexico City is the tourist-frequented state of Baja California Sur which includes Los Cabos. Subregions that have earned the World Travel and Tourism Council’s “Safe Travels stamp” which certifies a locale follows health protocols established by the WTTC include Los Cabos Cancun Riviera Maya Riviera Nayarit Yucatán Jalisco and the islands of Cozumel. “CDC recommends travelers avoid all nonessential international travel to Mexico. Travelers at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should consider postponing all travel including essential travel to Mexico” according to the CDC website. “Local policies at your destination may require you to be tested for COVID-19 before you are allowed to enter the country. If you test positive on arrival you may be required to isolate for a period of time. You may even be prevented from returning to the United States as scheduled.” Read more: Where can Americans travel to in the Caribbean?

D.C. legalized marijuana, but one thing didn’t change: Almost everyone arrested on pot charges is Black,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-marijuana-arrest-legal/2020/09/15/65c20348-d01b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
And while studies show that marijuana use is equally prevalent among Blacks and Whites 84 percent of more than 900 people arrested for public consumption in the nation’s capital were African American in the four years after legalization.A D.C. police spokeswoman declined to comment on the disparity noting that arrests for consumption or possession of small amounts of marijuana have declined significantly since legalization.But advocates and defense attorneys said police still focus on the city’s poorer mostly Black neighborhoods because that’s where officer deployments and investigations of violent crime are concentrated.Marijuana-related arrests they said are an entree for police to gather information about other alleged crimes.“They can use the odor of burning marijuana or street sales to pat people down for weapons or check for outstanding warrants” said Paul Zukerberg a defense lawyer who has represented clients arrested on pot charges. “They try to turn people into involuntary informants or state witnesses.”D.C. Superior Court does not maintain statistics for the dispositions of marijuana-related arrests. A Post review of more than 100 such cases shows that charges are often dropped or prosecutors negotiate plea bargains with probationary sentences. When defendants refuse a plea prosecutors in some instances have abandoned cases especially when relatively small amounts of marijuana are involved.Although punishments are often minimal Zukerberg said a marijuana arrest — no matter the outcome — often requires visits to court and other costly disruptions.“It can hurt people’s chances of getting employment and passing background checks while the case is pending” he said. “And a case can be pending for weeks months and years.” 'What the protests have been about' When advocates campaigned for Initiative 71 as the 2014 referendum measure for legalization was known a main selling point was that the reform would erase the gap between the numbers of Blacks and Whites penalized for using a drug that has wide appeal.By then a robust movement to relax marijuana laws across the country had emerged. A key driver was a 2013 American Civil Liberties Union study that revealed wide inequities in enforcement nationwide including in D.C. where police were eight times as likely to arrest Blacks as Whites for possession.The passage of Initiative 71 allowed individuals 21 or older to possess up to two ounces of marijuana on D.C. land cultivate as many as six pot plants at home give gifts of up to an ounce and possess drug paraphernalia such as pipes and bongs.But Republicans in Congress did not allow the city to eliminate penalties for public consumption or the buying and selling of cannabis. As a result street dealers remain a focus of “buy and bust” police investigations.“The goal was to not only eliminate the criminality associated with cannabis but to establish a regulatory system for distribution” said G. Malik Burnett a leader of the reform effort. “When there’s a gray area police are able to enforce what they feel they should enforce.”Earlier this month the D.C. Court of Appeals voted 2 to 1 to overturn the conviction of a man charged with possession with intent to distribute a decision that proponents of pot reform seized on as a victory.During a 2017 traffic stop in Southeast Washington U.S. Park Police caught Darnell Kornegay 25 who is African American with 1.7 ounces of pot a digital scale 23 empty plastic bags and $769 in cash. But Judge Catharine F. Easterly wrote that the amount of pot Kornegay had “did not exceed” the city’s legal limit and that no one witnessed a sale.“This ruling continues to show that the police need training on what the law says” said Adam Eidinger the lead organizer of the Initiative 71 campaign. “They need to see this as a signal that they’re misinterpreting the law.”Before legalization Blacks accounted for nearly 89 percent of the police department’s 8092 pot-related arrests from 2012 to 2014 The Post’s analysis shows. After legalization between 2015 and 2019 there were 3631 marijuana arrests. Eighty-nine percent of those arrested were Black.In 2015 the year pot was legalized overall arrests plummeted from 2095 to 314. Since then the volume of arrests has risen reaching 1007 in 2018 before falling to 798 last year the data shows.Arrests for possession dropped from 2488 in 2012 to 22 in 2015 and have remained around that number since. But annual arrests for public consumption seesawed from under 100 to more than 250 before declining. After initially decreasing arrests for distribution or intent to distribute have tripled in the past four years.D.C. police spokeswoman Kristen Metzger said in an emailed statement that the department “respects the intent” of Initiative 71 and “makes very few arrests” for smoking pot in public or possession.But Metzger also said that the department “takes illegal distribution especially where it is linked to violent crime very seriously and we will continue to protect our residents by enforcing these laws.”The Post’s analysis was drawn from a list of more than 11500 marijuana arrests between 2012 and 2019 provided by the police department in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The data does not include arrests made by other law enforcement agencies including U.S. Park Police.Men accounted for 89 percent of all marijuana arrests during the eight-year period. Of those males 90 percent were Black. Nearly 65 percent of those arrested were between ages 18 and 30.Before and after legalization just over 40 percent of the arrests occurred in Wards 7 and 8 which include the District’s poorest and most heavily African American neighborhoods. By contrast less than 1 percent of all arrests occurred in Ward 3 which encompasses neighborhoods such as Cleveland Park and Friendship Heights which are predominantly White and among the city’s most prosperous.A more racially diverse district Ward 1 which includes Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights accounted for nearly 16 percent of the arrests since legalization.D.C. Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) chairman of the Judiciary and Public Safety Committee described the disparities as “very discouraging” especially in light of the national focus on racial justice after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.“It gets back to the heart of what the protests have been about — uneven and unfair enforcement in policing along racial lines” Allen said. “We can change the laws but if we don’t change the nature of policing we’re not creating the impact we want.” Felony charges are rare A “strong odor of marijuana” wafting from Alexandre Foy’s car caught the attention of the police officer who stopped him in 2018 for failing to heed a pedestrian crossing signal outside the Watergate apartment complex.Foy then 35 an African American man from Lanham was already on probation in Maryland for pot possession and distribution something the officer learned after entering his name in a police database. A search of the car turned up 10.2 ounces of pot and nine vials of THC oil according to court records.“I had to do it I gotta feed my kids and family — I need the cash” Foy said according to the police complaint filed in court. Foy denied he was selling pot when reached by The Post. But he pleaded guilty to distribution after prosecutors reduced the charge from a felony to a misdemeanor. A judge suspended a six-month prison sentence and placed him on six months’ supervised probation.His case was among 115 marijuana arrests The Post reviewed that occurred between May 2018 and the end of 2019. In about 70 percent of the cases prosecutors either declined to file charges or dropped the case or the charges were dismissed. In about 10 percent of the cases a guilty plea resulted in probation.Douglas Jefferies among the 304 Whites arrested for marijuana between 2015 and 2019 was one of the few charged with a felony. Investigators found more than 24 pounds of pot 512 edibles and $16483 in cash last September at a Dupont Circle mansion he owned court records show. The mansion which Jefferies no longer owns had hosted pop-up marijuana shops.It was Jefferies’s third arrest in less than a year. In November 2018 officers raiding the mansion seized more than six pounds of pot dozens of pot-infused candies scales and $2210 in cash. Jefferies pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to time served.Four months later he was arrested again after police discovered nearly two pounds of pot and $6400 in cash in his Connecticut Avenue hotel room. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and a judge sentenced him to six months’ probation.In his current case court records show that Jefferies and prosecutors recently entered into a “stet agreement” which typically signifies that charges will be dropped if a defendant meets certain conditions.Jefferies did not respond to calls or text messages. Jefferies’s lawyer Marnitta King and a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment.Earlier this year a national ACLU study found that Blacks are 3.6 times as likely as Whites to be arrested for marijuana a rate “roughly the same” as in the organization’s study in 2013.Jon Gettman a Shenandoah University criminal justice professor said the racial disparity is fueled by police being deployed to high-crime areas that tend to be poor and predominantly Black.“It’s not that police are looking for weed busts in Anacostia” Gettman said. “It’s that there’s a lot more police activity in general in Anacostia than say Cleveland Park. It really has to do with the concentration of enforcement efforts.”But Vida Johnson a Georgetown University law professor who teaches in the school’s Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic said police make a concerted effort to look for illegal drug activity in Black neighborhoods.“Rather than go to American University or George Washington’s campus where we know there are marijuana sales they’re focusing on poor communities of color that are mostly African American” she said.“And to what end?” she asked. “We have already decided as a community that marijuana isn’t dangerous.” 'Rarely worth the effort' In Trey McNeil’s case according to court records undercover officers staking out an apartment building in Southeast Washington in 2019 said they saw him handing what they believed was a package of drugs to another man in exchange for cash.Police moved in to arrest McNeil then 27 an African American who lived in Congress Heights. Searching him they found just over an ounce of pot a digital scale and $117. He was charged with possession with intent to distribute.McNeil who could not be reached rejected a plea offer. Several months later after his lawyer filed a motion challenging the legality of the search and arrest prosecutors dropped the case.“I wasn’t surprised” said Joseph McCoy McNeil’s court-appointed lawyer. “These things are rarely worth the effort to prosecute.”Sometimes a pot bust is a precursor to a more serious crime.In April 2019 a judge sentenced Ja’amonte Jeter 21 to 12 months’ probation after he sold $20 of marijuana to an undercover officer on Benning Road NE. In Jeter’s pockets according to court records police found an ounce of weed three Xanax pills $129 and a scale.Ten months later after Jeter had violated his probation police charged him with shooting a man in the lower back across the street from where he was arrested for selling the pot.As part of a plea agreement Jeter admitted to attempted assault with a dangerous weapon and carrying an unlicensed pistol. A judge released Jeter from jail in August and placed him on home confinement while he awaits sentencing.Raymond Perry 29 was among the 220 people charged in 2018 for smoking pot in public. A team of undercover narcotics officers “observed” him getting high while he was in a lawn chair on a sidewalk in Northeast Washington according to court records.Reached by phone recently Perry said the officers handcuffed him and took him to the police station where he was fingerprinted and issued a citation requiring him to appear in court. At the hearing he paid a $25 fine.“I thought it was some BS but they were like ‘You’re not supposed to be doing it’ ” said Perry who described himself as an Uber driver and a rap artist.He said he is more cautious about smoking pot in public since the arrest. But that doesn’t mean he won’t light up.“I’m smoking right now” he said.,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-marijuana-arrest-legal/2020/09/15/65c20348-d01b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509

Hurricane Sally was crawling toward the Alabama and Mississippi coastline on Tuesday evening packing excessive to extreme rainfall. Flooding both coastal and freshwater will be the most widespread and dangerous hazard associated with this storm. The National Weather Service was warning that “historic life-threatening flash flooding is likely” as Sally’s worst rains arrive.All that excess water will pour into area rivers many of which are likely to reach moderate to major flood stage even after the rains begin to taper down Wednesday night.Hardest hit will probably be parts of southern Alabama and the adjacent Florida Panhandle where at least a dozen rivers are expected to crest at moderate or major flood stage. Record crests are possible based on current forecast trends.Among them is the Bayou Sara at Saraland on the northwest side of Mobile Bay. The river was predicted to crest at 8.5 feet.At that level the National Weather Service warns “numerous houses and streets flood east of the [railroad] between Bayou Sara and Norton Creek.” The Styx River in Elsanor Ala. east of Mobile was forecast to crest at 27.5 feet on Wednesday afternoon more than 10 feet above major flood stage. That would mark the river’s second-highest crest on record.At 21 feet “major flooding occurs to houses and streets along the river in Seminole Landing” along the Alabama-Florida border the National Weather Service wrote.Flooding is also likely near Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle where the Shoal River near Crestview on the northern edge of the base could peak four feet above major flood stage.Additional serious flooding is anticipated along rivers in Mobile and Baldwin counties in Alabama and Escambia Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.

Divorced and separated couples learn to navigate the ups and downs of custody during covid-19,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2020/09/15/divorced-separated-couples-learn-negotiate-ups-downs-custody-during-covid-19/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
“It presented a crack in the facade that we’re friends and super great co-parents or the poster children for divorce — any pressure cracked that really quickly” said the mother of four.Co-parents across the country have their work cut out for them. Even the most amicable relationship under constant duress such as a national health crisis can create friction. This is especially true for co-parents navigating complicated relationships with their exes. Trying to get in sync about a shared pandemic protocol or not as states reopen has left many families exhausted frustrated and — most of all — anxious.Joy said there are now more passive-aggressive text messages and arguments about how much the kids ages 13 and 16 should be allowed to leave home or socialize. Joy has started allowing the children to hang out with two other families actively following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Her ex-husband however continues to operate as he did in March. Their discussions have reached a stalemate but they continue to abide by their visitation agreement.The Washington Post spoke to co-parenting families such as Joy’s to understand how they’re making visitation family gatherings and life together work. Although some have found solutions arriving at the answer isn’t always neat or clean cut.Right around the time most states shut down in March Elliot Taub’s ex-partner contracted the coronavirus. He recalls much of that time raising their 8- and 12-year-old as intense adjusting to safety guidelines while his partner’s condition got worse before it got better. She was sick for about a month and half.“On one hand it was maybe okay because it kept me from focusing too much on what was going on” said Taub who works as an associate creative director at a pharmaceutical ad agency. “I was also just so exhausted by the end of the day.”Like many co-parents across the country Taub dealt with some of the difficult questions brought on by the pandemic. What if someone gets sick? What should parents do about play dates or school reopenings? Their formal separation agreement which they’ve tweaked as things happen for the past 18 months has helped. It ironed out visitation schedules and where the kids would live but the rest has been open and constant communication.Meanwhile issues such as children having more freedom at one house like Joy’s kids do compared with the other becomes a bigger parenting quandary about the safety and well-being of the child. For some families it’s an issue landing them in court. In response to the rise in custody questions states such as Wisconsin published guidance for parents with shared custody and Texas’s Supreme Court issued a statewide order that directed parents to follow their court-ordered schedules throughout the pandemic.Cases involving custody agreements have also started to inundate court systems already backed up because of the coronavirus. Evelyn Mitchell a partner at D.C.-area law firm Chludzinski & Mitchell said her firm has seen a spike in requests regarding custody and visitation.“I’ve been advising clients do as much as they can without the courts. The interesting thing is that covid hasn’t enticed people to settle ” she said. It’s difficult to have cases heard quickly during this time but Mitchell said parents aren’t settling out of concern about health and safety.In the event that co-parents struggle with communication licensed therapists such as Ajita Robinson are called in to help mediate rather than braving the long wait to the courtroom.She advises that parents find what they have in common during conflict. Typically it’s that both parties want what’s best for the kids. Even if they have different ideas about how she said “I find the breakdown is in the communication with the other parent.” When there’s conflict or communication that isn’t going to directly benefit the child it’s best not to engage said Robinson who also co-parents.Taub resides in Manhattan and his ex-wife lives in a separate apartment with a roommate in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. They alternate days staying with the children in their shared home in nearby Park Slope also in Brooklyn. Their answer to visitation during the pandemic is a practice known as nesting. Their kids live in Park Slope and they trade days or weekends in the house.Their amiable split has made open and consistent check-ins less difficult. Of course this isn’t easy if you aren’t on good terms but “it’s better if you let them know you’re considering their concerns as well” he said.When their son wanted to host a sleepover Taub’s co-parent deferred to him about what made him most comfortable. They decided on a socially distanced play date outside with masks on. For weekly visits they discussed cleaning and sanitizing the house before the other arrived. Mask-wearing and social distancing when apart were both agreed upon prior.Although a separation agreement can establish structure parents such as Najee James in Brooklyn take their chances negotiating with their co-parent.James got a job with Amazon at John F. Kennedy International Airport days before New York went into a state of emergency. He worried that his new job would expose his 2-year-old daughter who lives with him full time. “It was mentally challenging because I felt like I was putting my daughter at risk every single day I went to work” he said.He was laid off from Amazon about two months ago and has tested negative for the coronavirus but the experience made him consider the risks of exposure. James typically makes the executive decisions about him and his partner’s daughter but the pandemic meant they had to coordinate more. When they disagreed it was about using public transportation and how they spent their time separately but they have managed without getting the courts involved.James is the primary caretaker of his daughter Khaleesi and his ex regularly visits his apartment in Brooklyn.They “spoke about the basics — keeping our masks on and not interacting with people that wasn’t for work or immediate family” he said. Outside of his parents his daughter only spent the occasional weekend with her mom.New York is in Phase 4 of reopening so restaurants gyms and retail stores now operate with some restrictions. James and his ex continue to play it by ear and they are even hopeful about having a socially distanced birthday party for their daughter in the fall.“It’s tough to determine if it’s okay to do certain things” he said. At some point he plans on revisiting their visitation schedule.When the primary parent is used to making the decisions such as with James or Robinson negotiations can be mired in mudslinging over past wrongs. Co-parenting for more than a decade and a practicing mental health professional Robinson has learned to refocus.“You have to remember you aren’t doing the mom or dad a favor by granting their request” said the mother of two. “You are doing what’s in the best interest of your child.”Before the pandemic her kids would visit their dad’s on weekdays. Now Robinson’s children don’t rotate as often and they’ve implemented more virtual visitation. What factored into the family’s decision was Robinson’s non-coronavirus-related respiratory health concerns last year having a daughter with asthma and wanting to limit avenues for exposure. Her work as a self-employed therapist also offered the most flexibility for child care.Getting on the same page took time but compromise was an active part of their discussions. Traveling to see older relatives for example was where Robinson enforced her boundaries with her daughter’s father. She was okay with her visiting for Grandma’s birthday but she wasn’t comfortable with additional company outside of the grandparents.Other than her daughter’s grandparents being in a high-risk group Robinson had to consider another child at home.“The first few weeks there was some pushback. But I kept reiterating my concerns and where my points of flexibility were” she said.The battle ahead for co-parents is school reopenings. Najee James Ajita Robinson and Elliot Taub have talked with their co-parents about staying virtual for the foreseeable future. Julia Joy said she’s open to allowing her kids to attend Boise’s public schools in January but she’s anticipating more strained conversations with her ex-husband about it.“I don’t know what to do. Like should I get a court order? That’s when it’s going to be a real problem” Joy said.correctionDue to a source error this report incorrectly stated that Elliot Taub's son wanted to host a sleepover.

President Trump and Attorney General William Barr are a perfect match. The question is, who’s using whom?,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/09/15/william-barr-president-trump-perfect-match/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
One evening in May 1992 an obscure Catholic lay society in Arlington Va. presented its annual award to a 41-year-old political insider wise to Washington’s sub rosa realms. His name: William Pelham Barr. It was a coup for the Brent Society. Despite its low profile the group had landed a star honoree and featured speaker who had become attorney general of the United States of America just six months earlier after having served a stint as the interim holder of that post. As he was accepting the award the smoke had barely cleared in Los Angeles where violent demonstrations after the acquittal of three police officers in the beating of a Black motorist Rodney King prompted the deployment of thousands of federal troops. The unrest coming just months before a presidential election had thrust America deeper into a painful reckoning with evolving attitudes about race during a tumultuous time. Simultaneously a stubborn public health crisis filled hospital wards with HIV/AIDS the leading cause of death for men between the ages of 22 and 44. The culture wars particularly the fight over abortion were in full flower. Barr now finds himself again presiding as attorney general in an election year this time with the nation convulsed by the coronavirus pandemic and still beset by uncomfortable questions about race. But back then he’d puzzled out why Los Angeles was burning. There had been a “withering” of religious faith since the 1960s Barr said according to the text of his 1992 remarks. “Moral relativism and the pursuit of pleasure” he opined “were the order of the day.” The eruption in Los Angeles he reasoned could in part be attributed to “the general moral decline we see all about us in society.” It was not just the demonstrations that triggered Barr’s notions of an American descent into sinfulness. “Morally bad actions” he said “have bad practical consequences for society: HIV venereal disease is the price we pay among many others for sexual license.” Nearly three decades later the moralizing attorney general is incongruously knit with a profane philandering president who has boasted that his celebrity status gave him license to grab women by the “p---y.” Yet Barr who has railed in recent speeches against sexual “licentiousness” views the president in a more forgiving light. “I don’t consider him amoral” Barr told us matter-of-factly during an early September interview in his snug elegantly appointed Department of Justice office where pulled blinds let in the sparest of light. “I think all human beings have flaws. Everybody. And if we were to insist on perfection in our leaders you wouldn’t really have leaders.” Barr now stands as one of the most consequential figures in the administration of Donald Trump insulating the president from detractors bringing to life Trump’s law-and-order exhortations about public protest joining him in sowing doubt about the integrity of the upcoming election. Trump has turned out to be the ideal vessel for Barr’s decades-long pursuit of a potent “unitary executive” with few checks on his power and broad authority to swat away congressional demands. Theirs is a political marriage of perfect symmetry: a president who wants to do whatever he wants whenever he wants — and believes he can; an attorney general dedicated to endowing Oval Office occupants with expansive power. In Barr’s thinking the president is not the head of the executive branch of government which is a collection of dozens of agencies and sub-departments. Instead as Barr sees it the president and the president alone is the executive branch. Barr once served as attorney general for a president George H.W. Bush with a more modest view of executive power — and of himself. Teaming with Trump a self-centered self-aggrandizing child of privilege offered the opportunity of a lifetime. Few modern American political figures could have been expected to embrace Barr’s vision of a single human being embodying an entire branch of government with such rapaciousness as Trump. “I have the right to do whatever I want” Trump told a group of young conservatives in Washington five months after Barr took office in 2019. Barr and President Trump step off Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews after Trump’s visit to Kenosha Wis. in September. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) It is hard to know who benefits more from the relationship — who plays the music and who dances to the tune. Both use each other. Barr’s maneuverings have been pilloried as so baldly questionable and advantageous to Trump that his prosecutors have resigned in protest from at least three high-profile cases. Most recently a prosecutor quit the Justice Department entirely amid disagreements over the pace of a Barr-commissioned investigation about the Obama administration’s investigation of Russian connections to Trump’s 2016 campaign. Lumbering and generously jowled with a head of thick salt-and-pepper hair the 70-year-old Barr has become Trump’s legal avatar an explainer and softener of the president’s outrageous remarks (a “deep state” operation is underway to oust him). An enabler of his most audacious plans (sending police in riot gear and military personnel to clear a peaceful protest at the park across from the White House so the president could have a photo op in front of a church). An amplifier of his wild and most fact-challenged claims (mail-in ballots lead to widespread fraud and foreign governments could flood the nation with counterfeit ballots). Little of the sly wit Barr displays in person emerges as he defends the president in television appearances and other interviews that as the election approaches have turned him into the president’s most effective campaign surrogate. Instead he often evinces the mien of the grouchy uncle. “Donald Trump is as much a tool of Bill Barr as Bill Barr is a tool of Donald Trump” says Donald Ayer a former deputy attorney general and Republican stalwart who served with Barr at the Department of Justice in the 1980s and has become one of his most prominent critics. “I think Barr sees Trump as an extraordinary opportunity to advance his agenda which he’s had for many years of making the president an autocrat.” Ayer’s view is shared by many but there are those who want to assure the country that there’s really nothing amiss. Barr’s views about a unitary executive are “not exactly far out” says Michael Mukasey a conservative who served as attorney general under President George W. Bush. “I don’t think that for the Justice Department to take that view and pursue it in particular cases is unreasonable.” Barr says his Catholic faith gives him “a solid grounding and a balance. It’s one of the reasons I really don’t care what people think.” Barr came into office in early 2019 enrobed in the hope even among many Democrats that he would serve as a guardrail for a reckless president. Now Barr’s critics including hundreds of former Justice Department officials want him to resign in shame. “I don’t really care what the public thinks — or especially the media and you know the political class” Barr told us. His Catholic faith he continued gives him “a solid grounding and a balance. It’s one of the reasons I really don’t care what people think.” Before the interview Barr asked whether he should wear a mask when he strolled into the conference room next to his office. Above his head massive murals titled “Justice Triumphant” and “Justice Defeated” loomed at the top of the curved ceiling a tableau that represents the polar opposite views of his rocky tenure as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer. He answered the question about the mask himself cracking that he “thought you’d want to see my lips.” Barr’s shrinking cadre of defenders have found fewer receptive ears for their argument that he is misunderstood and for their laments that history will judge him harshly as a partisan hack. “The attorney general has been politically crucified by his partisan foes and the media” J. Michael Luttig a former federal judge who worked alongside Barr in the George H.W. Bush administration says in a rare interview. The first of Barr’s supposed sins Luttig says is the most elemental and insurmountable: “He is President Trump’s attorney general.” Barr in September. A photograph of George Patton hung in the office of Malcolm Wilkey a respected conservative judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit who served as a World War II intelligence officer in the famed general’s Third Army. The young attorney asking to be Wilkey’s clerk held scant hope of getting the job. But as soon as Bill Barr a military history buff mentioned the Third Army and displayed an encyclopedic knowledge of the war he was in. Wilkey’s periodic lunches with his clerks sometimes devolved into the judge and Barr positioning salt and pepper shakers on the table diagraming battle formations. Barr could charm his colleagues with a ready laugh and a sense of humor that David Hiller a fellow clerk and future publisher of the Los Angeles Times says landed somewhere between “wry and devilish.” Barr was a tangle of improbabilities: a deeply conservative Catholic whose father a Columbia University educator and headmaster of elite private prep schools was born Jewish but enthusiastically embraced Catholicism. In our interview Barr interrupted a question to emphasize that his father’s family members were “secular Jews. They were atheists.” Barr fashions himself an outlier — when he was growing up and now. In elementary school he was the Upper West Side son who studied alongside less fortunate Black Latino and Irish kids whose parents weren’t Columbia educators like his. At Horace Mann the elite New York prep school he attended “everyone” he says “had been to everyone’s bar mitzvah. They all went to temple dances.” He notes “I think there were like three Christians in my class.” The pattern continued while he was attending Columbia amid the counterculture heyday and sexual revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s — a period he views as a demarcation point in America’s moral collapse. In Barr’s freshman year an instructor announced a course would focus on “why organized religion is no longer tenable.” Barr recalls being one of only two students to raise their hands when the instructor asked how many students “believe in organized religion.” Still he got an A-plus when he wrote a counterargument. In Washington the product of highbrow schools became a bit more of a scrapper. In a sea of Harvard- Yale- and Georgetown-pedigreed lawyers he worked on his law degree at George Washington University night school which lacked the same cachet. He’d moved to Washington just two days after marrying the woman who became his wife of more than four decades Christine Moynihan Barr a school librarian who is now retired. The couple have three adult children including a daughter Mary Daly a lawyer who worked at the Justice Department before Barr took office and now is in the Treasury Department. His route to the prestigious Wilkey clerkship wound through a six-year stint at the Central Intelligence Agency where he worked in the Office of Legislative Counsel and the Intelligence Directorate. While there his monitoring of congressional investigations of the intelligence community made him wary of CIA FBI and National Security Agency excesses according to friends and aides speaking anonymously to relate Barr’s private musings. “He believes that the FBI and the national security state is powerful. It can be a force for good — and it can turn into the German Stasi” one aide says referring to the notorious East German security agency. Barr’s cautious view of the intelligence community is more nuanced than that of Trump. But their shared doubts about the FBI’s and CIA’s investigation in 2016 have been the underpinning of Barr’s pre-election Russia probe. He receives frequent updates on the investigation — sometimes daily — which is being conducted by John Durham a U.S. attorney from Connecticut. “I think Barr sees Trump as an extraordinary opportunity to advance his agenda which he’s had for many years of making the president an autocrat” says Donald Ayer a former deputy attorney general who served with Barr at the Department of Justice in the 1980s. Behind the scenes frictions have emerged between Durham and Barr over the attorney general’s pushing his handpicked choice to work faster to publicly issue his findings according to two people familiar with the tensions. Barr made a marked shift in his tone and terminology during our interview veering from his previous statements that Durham and he would likely release a “report” in the summer. Instead Barr used more vague language saying only that there would be a “public accounting” and refusing to discuss the timing. Three days after the interview the Justice Department was rocked by the resignation of a top Durham lieutenant prosecutor Nora Dannehy — a highly public indication of troubled internal discussions about releasing findings so close to the presidential election. Barr’s initial vector to the heights of the American criminal justice system would eventually point through the world of party politics where he became a master speed-climber of interior staircases. He zoomed in just three years from a spot on the team vetting vice-presidential candidates for George H.W. Bush’s 1988 campaign to the post of attorney general — an astonishing rise for a lawyer a decade-and-a-half out of law school. At his first stop in Bush’s administration as director of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel Barr wrote an opinion that cleared the way along with another legal analysis to allow Bush to capture Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and bring him to the United States. Barr resisted congressional requests for the opinion providing a summary that omitted some of his reasoning including the assertion that the president could violate the United Nations charter. “It was like observing an athlete making his signature move” says Harold Hongju Koh a Yale Law School professor who is a former top official in the State Department and Justice Department in Democratic administrations. Koh and others saw echoes of that intransigence and obfuscation in spring of last year during the defining moment of Barr’s tenure as Trump’s attorney general when he released a summary of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign more than three weeks before publicly disclosing the full 448-page report.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) Barr’s distillation of Mueller’s highly detailed but ultimately wishy-washy report dutifully noted deep in the text of the four-page summary that the investigators had not exonerated the president. But the headline-generating lines of Barr’s summary dealt with the special counsel’s decision not to reach a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice. To Trump’s great benefit Barr left out the damning details of 10 instances of possible obstruction by Trump. In addition Barr left out the key point that Mueller found multiple contacts between Trump campaign officials and people linked to the Russian government and that the campaign looked to benefit from Kremlin interference. Barr’s preemptive handling of the Mueller report allowed Trump to dominate the initial news cycle and cement a narrative even though he was clearly overstating his attorney general’s summary. “No Collusion No Obstruction Complete and Total EXONERATION” Trump tweeted. Ever since Barr and his closest allies have privately puzzled that he hasn’t gotten credit for eventually releasing the report which contains scads of damaging material about Trump. Barr supporter Luttig told us “The fact is that the attorney general could not have more perfectly accurately and faithfully described the special counsel’s conclusions.” Some viewed Barr’s handling of the report as a shocking departure for a respected attorney. But it was more an echo of Barr’s long-held — though selective — disdain for independent counsels. Ken Starr who served as the U.S. solicitor general the first time Barr was attorney general remembers extended chats with Barr decrying a Supreme Court decision that upheld the independent counsel act in a case stemming from a U.S. House of Representatives investigation. “The hellions of an independent counsel demonstrated to us the profound flaws of the [independent counsel] statute” Starr says chuckling a bit at the irony of his distaste for independent counsels given that he was the most prominent independent counsel before Mueller. “That united us in the conclusion that you had to really watch out for Congress and you especially had to watch out for the House of Representatives.” (Barr later looked favorably on Starr’s work as independent counsel saying the law required his appointment.) Barr’s tinkerings at the Office of Legal Counsel have been resurrected in defense of Trump. In May 2019 Trump banked on the current OLC — which relied in part on a 30-year-old opinion Barr had written — to refuse a congressional request to review the president’s tax returns. Still there were moments in his first tenure as attorney general when Barr showed the restraint that so many hoped he’d demonstrate as Trump’s attorney general. In the final stretch of Bush’s term he blocked a plan to have the president unilaterally index capital gains to inflation which would have energized wealthy Republicans during his foundering reelection campaign. “Here is something that the White House counsel very badly wanted that would have been politically beneficial to the president” says David Rivkin a prominent conservative lawyer who wrote the memo in support of the idea while he was in the White House counsel’s office. “What does it tell you about Bill Barr? It does not seem like the action of a yes man.” Barr during the announcement that he would be the next attorney general under President George H.W. Bush in 1991. (Dirck Halstead/Getty Images) Bush’s defeat by Bill Clinton in the 1992 election shoved the still-youthful attorney general through Washington’s revolving door where he eventually settled in for a long run as general counsel of the telecommunications company now called Verizon. He got rich. He was a foreigner to Washington’s social scene whose aversion to being a joiner meant he didn’t become a member of elite private clubs or even enlist in the Federalist Society the highly influential conservative group so closely aligned with his philosophy. His one big foray into socializing was the annual “ceilidh” parties — named for the traditional Scottish and Irish music-centric get-togethers — that he’d throw at fancy hotels. At other times he’d play bagpipes at gatherings of fellow enthusiasts. (Asked how the first sentences of his obituary should read he says with a loud chuckle there should be only one word: “Piper.”) With copious time on his hands he wrote and sold a screenplay about Capt. Ernest Evans a World War II Naval commander renowned for his heroism fighting a much larger Japanese force. But Barr was out of the action in the halls of Washington power. He knew it. He missed it. His friend Jonathan Turley — a George Washington University law school professor — would sometimes send him draft copies of briefs. Once Turley recalls Barr called him at 2 in the morning from a corporate jet to point out a missing preposition in a footnote on page 20. In 1995 Barr wrote an article for the Catholic Lawyer journal in which he framed a “historic struggle” between “secularism” and “the traditional Judeo-Christian moral system.” They’re themes he has echoed in his current role calling Black Lives Matter activists “Bolsheviks” in a Fox News interview and saying “the left wants power because that is essentially their state of grace in their secular religion.” (On the other hand he says “saving Black lives” through programs such as Operation Legend which dispatches federal law enforcement officers to cities where violence is surging is perhaps his greatest accomplishment.) Barr often argues — citing Catholic thinkers and the Founding Fathers — that the demise of the Judeo-Christian system could imperil the existence of the American government. “For the Republic to work” he wrote in the journal article “people must be guided by ... commonly shared moral values.” It’s a view he still holds telling us that “over the long run the fewer and fewer people who have religion the less stable government becomes.” During the covid-19 pandemic Barr has marshaled his Justice Department to support the right of churches to hold services. In his own words he has “jawboned” governors to treat churches the same as any other public gatherings while imposing restrictions to limit the spread of the killer virus. In his journal article he again took on homosexuality. Barr looked askance at “the effort to apply District of Columbia law to compel Georgetown University to treat homosexual activist groups like any other student group. This kind of law dissolves any form of moral consensus in society” he wrote. Gay and lesbian organizations expressed concern when Barr was nominated to be Trump’s attorney general citing his past comments. Barr’s Justice Department recently filed a Supreme Court brief arguing that Catholic Social Services in Philadelphia which receives taxpayer funding should be allowed to refuse to place adoptive and foster children with same-sex couples. Barr’s longtime friend former Time Warner chief counsel Paul Cappuccio who is in a same-sex marriage and raising three children says: “There is no intolerance in Bill Barr other than perhaps intolerance of stupidity.” Cappuccio had worried about discussing his relationship and marriage with some of his conservative friends and mentors — but not Barr. He recalls Barr coming over to him at a reception not long after he got married in 2013: “I have to meet this guy. I’ve got to make sure he’s the right fit for ‘The Pooch’ “ Barr said using Cappuccio’s childhood nickname. Barr’s preemptive handling of the Mueller report allowed Trump to dominate the initial news cycle and cement a narrative. After stepping down from Verizon in 2008 — the year he turned 58 — he entered a long restless semiretirement in which he did some consulting and was counsel in the Washington office of the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. He also served on the board of the Catholic Information Center a downtown gathering spot and place of worship that has featured priests from the ultraconservative Opus Dei wing of Catholicism. During his first term as attorney general Barr had hired as a speechwriter John Paul Wauck who later became an Opus Dei priest and has kept in periodic touch with him. So many people have assumed that Barr is a member of Opus Dei that the secretive organization issued a statement saying he is not. In those years he would periodically meet Turley for long lunches at a favorite Italian restaurant Assaggi Osteria in McLean Va. where he lives. They’d linger long after the plates were cleared gnawing over large and minuscule points in law. Afterward it wasn’t uncommon for Barr to send Turley lengthy memos — just because. Barr wanted someone to listen to him. In June 2018 Barr sent an unsolicited 19-page memo to the Justice Department the White House counsel and others. In it he argued that even though he was “in the dark about many facts” he wanted to share his conclusion that the investigation by his longtime friend special counsel Robert Mueller seemed to be a “misbegotten effort to ‘disempower’ ” Trump. The president had “illimitable” powers to hire and fire his then FBI director James Comey who’d investigated Russian interference Barr wrote. Once again he’d pushed his objective of building a muscular presidency. But this time there was a president in office who was more than eager to go along. While then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions a Trump loyalist was beginning to have frictions with the president Barr — who is a friend of Sessions — offered private advice on managing the relationship with a difficult Oval Office occupant. Within months of Sessions’ ouster Barr’s name was being floated as attorney general to replace the much-panned interim choice Matthew Whitaker. Unlike some other Trump cabinet choices Barr was not a political supporter of the president’s. He had significant doubts about Trump’s suitability for office a friend says on condition of anonymity. Yet when Trump called Barr accepted the job reasoning that he could reshape the Justice Department to his liking. For the first time in a quarter century Barr was really relevant again. Barr became Trump's attorney general in 2019. In April 2019 emails and text messages flooded into Brian Rabbitt’s phone as Barr’s then-chief of staff sat just behind the attorney general as he testified before a Senate committee. “Twitter is going crazy” one text read. Social media was ablaze because Barr had uttered a single word: “spying.” Rabbitt stiffened when he heard it. He knew trouble was coming. Barr’s unequivocal remark about the intelligence community’s Russian interference investigation gave a lofty imprimatur to the president’s long-standing unsubstantiated claims that the Obama administration had spied on his election effort. It suggested to some that Barr had prejudged the Obama administration’s actions while the attorney general’s investigation into the early stages of the probe was still in its infancy. Before the hearing ended with his staff in a state of high anxiety Barr shifted into damage-control mode telling senators that he’d only meant to say “surveillance.” He was “concerned” and “looking into it.” On the ride back to the Justice Department his senior staff tried to explain the fuss a tempest Barr told them was “ridiculous.” “Barr couldn’t believe it was such a big deal” says a staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate a private conversation. “He really didn’t care what the reaction was.” In the high-wire months to come Barr’s inner circle stood by him and supported his decisions — even as some prosecutors who directly handled investigations and trials resigned in protest over his decisions. They’d bonded over conference tables and cocktails. Barr who isn’t a big drinker keeps bottles of blended and single malt whiskeys in his office for occasional impromptu end-of-the-day decompression get-togethers with his staff. Once during a stopover in Dublin on an overseas trip Barr joined staffers at a divey pub where he knew the musician and was immediately recognized. Barr had memorized the words to the Irish ballads and belted them out. But even some of his closest staff didn’t know about his philanthropic efforts. He now pays tuition for 18 underprivileged kids to attend Catholic schools in New York City from kindergarten through 12th grade as part of a church program he’s participated in for many years. In the weeks after his bombshell appearance at the Senate committee hearing Barr would toss aside his measured tone flatly telling Fox News and the Wall Street Journal that spying had taken place. Barr thought the controversy was so “absurd” that he deliberately chose to use the word “spying” in defiance of media talking heads according to a person familiar with his thinking. Barr poses for photos with guests at the White House Summit on Human Trafficking in January. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The attorney general’s comments — no longer hedging — were only a hint of what many perceived as a Barr-Trump Trump-Barr echo chamber with the two men repeating each other’s themes sometimes months apart sometimes days apart. Trump has frequently said Democrats are trying to stage a “coup.” Barr didn’t dispute that suggestion when asked about it on Fox News but used softer language saying that an “organized effort” may be afoot to remove Trump from office. Critics say their claims about mail-in voting undermine confidence in the upcoming election. The interplay between Trump and Barr on the key election issues has resurrected long-standing allegations that the attorney general is following the president’s lead on prosecutorial decisions. Barr’s choice to intervene and recommend a lower sentence than his courtroom prosecutors in the case of Roger Stone — the political trickster and Trump friend convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice — came shortly after the president tweeted that the prosecutors’ recommendation was unfair. All four Stone prosecutors resigned in protest and more than 1000 former Justice Department officials signed a letter calling on Barr to step down. After the prosecutors learned of Barr’s maneuver — not from the attorney general but from media reports — some of them ended up at the Carving Room a hip restaurant and bar near Washington’s Judiciary Square where the place was filling up with angry DOJ officials. When one of the prosecutors walked in the room erupted in applause. Another prosecutor resigned from a case when Barr sought to throw out the charges against Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The decision which is being held up by a federal judge prompted 2000 former Justice officials to call for Barr’s resignation. Barr also has gone on the offensive against Trump enemies trying to block publication of former national security adviser John Bolton’s unflattering book about the president and taking an unusual step by having the Justice Department replace Trump’s personal attorneys in a defamation suit filed by E. Jean Carroll who says she was raped by the president in the mid-1990s. Those episodes demonstrated a call-and-response pattern: Trump complaining Barr doing. Still Barr is forever protesting that his actions are not dictated by the president. “The president’s constant comments undermined what we were trying to do” says a senior staffer who spoke anonymously to describe closed-door conversations with Barr. “This was a constant frustration.” The same phenomenon appeared in the summer of 2019 when California cut an emissions standards deal tougher than Trump’s plan. The Justice Department made no attempt to block the arrangement until Trump tweeted against it. The next day Justice announced an antitrust investigation of the deal. Career staff questioned the legal and factual basis for the investigation; Barr says he had nothing to do with the decision. And a week after Trump tweeted about alleged bias against conservatives by Google this past summer the Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation of the search giant prompting more internal complaints. “I have no sympathy for that” Barr says about the complaints. “I feel that the antitrust division has been 20 years behind the times and one of the reasons we have these very large companies is because they have essentially fallen asleep at the switch. So it’s time for them to put some elbow grease into this and get things resolved.” Amid the rampant criticisms Barr has said that Stone’s prosecution was “righteous” but the sentencing recommendation was “excessive” a view shared by the sentencing judge. Trump later undercut his attorney general commuting Stone’s sentence and sparing him from serving any time in prison. Barr’s move on Bolton he told us stemmed from his assertion which Bolton disputes that the former national security adviser hadn’t gotten proper pre-publication approvals. Barr says he also disapproved of Bolton writing about officials still in office. And he has framed the decision to get involved in the Carroll case as routine because Trump’s comments disputing her rape claims were made within “the scope” of his work as president. Barr’s actions — whether politically intended or not — have lately aided Trump’s promotion of himself as a law-and-order president with a miles-wide fiat to rule. Barr has marshaled federal law enforcement to tamp down protests in the aftermath of the killing of a Black man George Floyd while in police custody. At times Barr has served as a kind of translator for Trump. When the president without evidence accused Obama of committing treason Barr turned apologist telling CNN in early September that “ ‘treason’ is a legal term. I think he’s using it colloquially. To commit treason you actually have to have a state of war with a foreign enemy but I think he feels that they were involved in an injustice and if he feels that he can say it.” Stuart Gerson a conservative former head of the Justice Department’s civil division under George H.W. Bush sees subtle gamesmanship at play. “Trump is not intelligent or incisive but Bill Barr is both. So in this situation Trump is the tail and Barr is the dog” Gerson says. “Trump is the canvas on which Barr can paint his picture.” He’s always there wherever Barr turns: Trump. Inescapable a figure superimposed in everything Barr sketches. Or is it a trick of the dimming light? During our interview Barr sat back comfortably on the burgundy sofa in his office at home in the realm he has occupied at the beginning of his 40s and 70s. Asked to assess his latest turn as a public servant a sly smile crossed his face. “I’d give myself high grades” he said. “But since we all have foibles I’m not sure it’s an A-plus.” The piper pleased with the sound of it chuckled.

President Trump and Attorney General William Barr are a perfect match. The question is, who’s using whom?,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/09/15/william-barr-president-trump-perfect-match/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
One evening in May 1992 an obscure Catholic lay society in Arlington Va. presented its annual award to a 41-year-old political insider wise to Washington’s sub rosa realms. His name: William Pelham Barr. It was a coup for the Brent Society. Despite its low profile the group had landed a star honoree and featured speaker who had become attorney general of the United States of America just six months earlier after having served a stint as the interim holder of that post. As he was accepting the award the smoke had barely cleared in Los Angeles where violent demonstrations after the acquittal of three police officers in the beating of a Black motorist Rodney King prompted the deployment of thousands of federal troops. The unrest coming just months before a presidential election had thrust America deeper into a painful reckoning with evolving attitudes about race during a tumultuous time. Simultaneously a stubborn public health crisis filled hospital wards with HIV/AIDS the leading cause of death for men between the ages of 22 and 44. The culture wars particularly the fight over abortion were in full flower. Barr now finds himself again presiding as attorney general in an election year this time with the nation convulsed by the coronavirus pandemic and still beset by uncomfortable questions about race. But back then he’d puzzled out why Los Angeles was burning. There had been a “withering” of religious faith since the 1960s Barr said according to the text of his 1992 remarks. “Moral relativism and the pursuit of pleasure” he opined “were the order of the day.” The eruption in Los Angeles he reasoned could in part be attributed to “the general moral decline we see all about us in society.” It was not just the demonstrations that triggered Barr’s notions of an American descent into sinfulness. “Morally bad actions” he said “have bad practical consequences for society: HIV venereal disease is the price we pay among many others for sexual license.” Nearly three decades later the moralizing attorney general is incongruously knit with a profane philandering president who has boasted that his celebrity status gave him license to grab women by the “p---y.” Yet Barr who has railed in recent speeches against sexual “licentiousness” views the president in a more forgiving light. “I don’t consider him amoral” Barr told us matter-of-factly during an early September interview in his snug elegantly appointed Department of Justice office where pulled blinds let in the sparest of light. “I think all human beings have flaws. Everybody. And if we were to insist on perfection in our leaders you wouldn’t really have leaders.” Barr now stands as one of the most consequential figures in the administration of Donald Trump insulating the president from detractors bringing to life Trump’s law-and-order exhortations about public protest joining him in sowing doubt about the integrity of the upcoming election. Trump has turned out to be the ideal vessel for Barr’s decades-long pursuit of a potent “unitary executive” with few checks on his power and broad authority to swat away congressional demands. Theirs is a political marriage of perfect symmetry: a president who wants to do whatever he wants whenever he wants — and believes he can; an attorney general dedicated to endowing Oval Office occupants with expansive power. In Barr’s thinking the president is not the head of the executive branch of government which is a collection of dozens of agencies and sub-departments. Instead as Barr sees it the president and the president alone is the executive branch. Barr once served as attorney general for a president George H.W. Bush with a more modest view of executive power — and of himself. Teaming with Trump a self-centered self-aggrandizing child of privilege offered the opportunity of a lifetime. Few modern American political figures could have been expected to embrace Barr’s vision of a single human being embodying an entire branch of government with such rapaciousness as Trump. “I have the right to do whatever I want” Trump told a group of young conservatives in Washington five months after Barr took office in 2019.

(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) It is hard to know who benefits more from the relationship — who plays the music and who dances to the tune. Both use each other. Barr’s maneuverings have been pilloried as so baldly questionable and advantageous to Trump that his prosecutors have resigned in protest from at least three high-profile cases. Most recently a prosecutor quit the Justice Department entirely amid disagreements over the pace of a Barr-commissioned investigation about the Obama administration’s investigation of Russian connections to Trump’s 2016 campaign. Lumbering and generously jowled with a head of thick salt-and-pepper hair the 70-year-old Barr has become Trump’s legal avatar an explainer and softener of the president’s outrageous remarks (a “deep state” operation is underway to oust him). An enabler of his most audacious plans (sending police in riot gear and military personnel to clear a peaceful protest at the park across from the White House so the president could have a photo op in front of a church). An amplifier of his wild and most fact-challenged claims (mail-in ballots lead to widespread fraud and foreign governments could flood the nation with counterfeit ballots). Little of the sly wit Barr displays in person emerges as he defends the president in television appearances and other interviews that as the election approaches have turned him into the president’s most effective campaign surrogate. Instead he often evinces the mien of the grouchy uncle. “Donald Trump is as much a tool of Bill Barr as Bill Barr is a tool of Donald Trump” says Donald Ayer a former deputy attorney general and Republican stalwart who served with Barr at the Department of Justice in the 1980s and has become one of his most prominent critics. “I think Barr sees Trump as an extraordinary opportunity to advance his agenda which he’s had for many years of making the president an autocrat.” Ayer’s view is shared by many but there are those who want to assure the country that there’s really nothing amiss. Barr’s views about a unitary executive are “not exactly far out” says Michael Mukasey a conservative who served as attorney general under President George W. Bush. “I don’t think that for the Justice Department to take that view and pursue it in particular cases is unreasonable.” Barr says his Catholic faith gives him “a solid grounding and a balance. It’s one of the reasons I really don’t care what people think.” Barr came into office in early 2019 enrobed in the hope even among many Democrats that he would serve as a guardrail for a reckless president. Now Barr’s critics including hundreds of former Justice Department officials want him to resign in shame. “I don’t really care what the public thinks — or especially the media and you know the political class” Barr told us. His Catholic faith he continued gives him “a solid grounding and a balance. It’s one of the reasons I really don’t care what people think.” Before the interview Barr asked whether he should wear a mask when he strolled into the conference room next to his office. Above his head massive murals titled “Justice Triumphant” and “Justice Defeated” loomed at the top of the curved ceiling a tableau that represents the polar opposite views of his rocky tenure as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer. He answered the question about the mask himself cracking that he “thought you’d want to see my lips.” Barr’s shrinking cadre of defenders have found fewer receptive ears for their argument that he is misunderstood and for their laments that history will judge him harshly as a partisan hack. “The attorney general has been politically crucified by his partisan foes and the media” J. Michael Luttig a former federal judge who worked alongside Barr in the George H.W. Bush administration says in a rare interview. The first of Barr’s supposed sins Luttig says is the most elemental and insurmountable: “He is President Trump’s attorney general.” Barr in September. A photograph of George Patton hung in the office of Malcolm Wilkey a respected conservative judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit who served as a World War II intelligence officer in the famed general’s Third Army. The young attorney asking to be Wilkey’s clerk held scant hope of getting the job. But as soon as Bill Barr a military history buff mentioned the Third Army and displayed an encyclopedic knowledge of the war he was in. Wilkey’s periodic lunches with his clerks sometimes devolved into the judge and Barr positioning salt and pepper shakers on the table diagraming battle formations. Barr could charm his colleagues with a ready laugh and a sense of humor that David Hiller a fellow clerk and future publisher of the Los Angeles Times says landed somewhere between “wry and devilish.” Barr was a tangle of improbabilities: a deeply conservative Catholic whose father a Columbia University educator and headmaster of elite private prep schools was born Jewish but enthusiastically embraced Catholicism. In our interview Barr interrupted a question to emphasize that his father’s family members were “secular Jews. They were atheists.” Barr fashions himself an outlier — when he was growing up and now. In elementary school he was the Upper West Side son who studied alongside less fortunate Black Latino and Irish kids whose parents weren’t Columbia educators like his. At Horace Mann the elite New York prep school he attended “everyone” he says “had been to everyone’s bar mitzvah. They all went to temple dances.” He notes “I think there were like three Christians in my class.” The pattern continued while he was attending Columbia amid the counterculture heyday and sexual revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s — a period he views as a demarcation point in America’s moral collapse. In Barr’s freshman year an instructor announced a course would focus on “why organized religion is no longer tenable.” Barr recalls being one of only two students to raise their hands when the instructor asked how many students “believe in organized religion.” Still he got an A-plus when he wrote a counterargument. In Washington the product of highbrow schools became a bit more of a scrapper. In a sea of Harvard- Yale- and Georgetown-pedigreed lawyers he worked on his law degree at George Washington University night school which lacked the same cachet. He’d moved to Washington just two days after marrying the woman who became his wife of more than four decades Christine Moynihan Barr a school librarian who is now retired. The couple have three adult children including a daughter Mary Daly a lawyer who worked at the Justice Department before Barr took office and now is in the Treasury Department. His route to the prestigious Wilkey clerkship wound through a six-year stint at the Central Intelligence Agency where he worked in the Office of Legislative Counsel and the Intelligence Directorate. While there his monitoring of congressional investigations of the intelligence community made him wary of CIA FBI and National Security Agency excesses according to friends and aides speaking anonymously to relate Barr’s private musings. “He believes that the FBI and the national security state is powerful. It can be a force for good — and it can turn into the German Stasi” one aide says referring to the notorious East German security agency. Barr’s cautious view of the intelligence community is more nuanced than that of Trump. But their shared doubts about the FBI’s and CIA’s investigation in 2016 have been the underpinning of Barr’s pre-election Russia probe. He receives frequent updates on the investigation — sometimes daily — which is being conducted by John Durham a U.S. attorney from Connecticut. “I think Barr sees Trump as an extraordinary opportunity to advance his agenda which he’s had for many years of making the president an autocrat” says Donald Ayer a former deputy attorney general who served with Barr at the Department of Justice in the 1980s. Behind the scenes frictions have emerged between Durham and Barr over the attorney general’s pushing his handpicked choice to work faster to publicly issue his findings according to two people familiar with the tensions. Barr made a marked shift in his tone and terminology during our interview veering from his previous statements that Durham and he would likely release a “report” in the summer. Instead Barr used more vague language saying only that there would be a “public accounting” and refusing to discuss the timing. Three days after the interview the Justice Department was rocked by the resignation of a top Durham lieutenant prosecutor Nora Dannehy — a highly public indication of troubled internal discussions about releasing findings so close to the presidential election. Barr’s initial vector to the heights of the American criminal justice system would eventually point through the world of party politics where he became a master speed-climber of interior staircases. He zoomed in just three years from a spot on the team vetting vice-presidential candidates for George H.W. Bush’s 1988 campaign to the post of attorney general — an astonishing rise for a lawyer a decade-and-a-half out of law school. At his first stop in Bush’s administration as director of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel Barr wrote an opinion that cleared the way along with another legal analysis to allow Bush to capture Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and bring him to the United States. Barr resisted congressional requests for the opinion providing a summary that omitted some of his reasoning including the assertion that the president could violate the United Nations charter. “It was like observing an athlete making his signature move” says Harold Hongju Koh a Yale Law School professor who is a former top official in the State Department and Justice Department in Democratic administrations. Koh and others saw echoes of that intransigence and obfuscation in spring of last year during the defining moment of Barr’s tenure as Trump’s attorney general when he released a summary of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign more than three weeks before publicly disclosing the full 448-page report. Barr at the White House on the day Trump signed an executive order on policing reforms in June. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) Barr’s distillation of Mueller’s highly detailed but ultimately wishy-washy report dutifully noted deep in the text of the four-page summary that the investigators had not exonerated the president. But the headline-generating lines of Barr’s summary dealt with the special counsel’s decision not to reach a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice. To Trump’s great benefit Barr left out the damning details of 10 instances of possible obstruction by Trump. In addition Barr left out the key point that Mueller found multiple contacts between Trump campaign officials and people linked to the Russian government and that the campaign looked to benefit from Kremlin interference. Barr’s preemptive handling of the Mueller report allowed Trump to dominate the initial news cycle and cement a narrative even though he was clearly overstating his attorney general’s summary. “No Collusion No Obstruction Complete and Total EXONERATION” Trump tweeted. Ever since Barr and his closest allies have privately puzzled that he hasn’t gotten credit for eventually releasing the report which contains scads of damaging material about Trump. Barr supporter Luttig told us “The fact is that the attorney general could not have more perfectly accurately and faithfully described the special counsel’s conclusions.” Some viewed Barr’s handling of the report as a shocking departure for a respected attorney. But it was more an echo of Barr’s long-held — though selective — disdain for independent counsels. Ken Starr who served as the U.S. solicitor general the first time Barr was attorney general remembers extended chats with Barr decrying a Supreme Court decision that upheld the independent counsel act in a case stemming from a U.S. House of Representatives investigation. “The hellions of an independent counsel demonstrated to us the profound flaws of the [independent counsel] statute” Starr says chuckling a bit at the irony of his distaste for independent counsels given that he was the most prominent independent counsel before Mueller. “That united us in the conclusion that you had to really watch out for Congress and you especially had to watch out for the House of Representatives.” (Barr later looked favorably on Starr’s work as independent counsel saying the law required his appointment.) Barr’s tinkerings at the Office of Legal Counsel have been resurrected in defense of Trump. In May 2019 Trump banked on the current OLC — which relied in part on a 30-year-old opinion Barr had written — to refuse a congressional request to review the president’s tax returns. Still there were moments in his first tenure as attorney general when Barr showed the restraint that so many hoped he’d demonstrate as Trump’s attorney general. In the final stretch of Bush’s term he blocked a plan to have the president unilaterally index capital gains to inflation which would have energized wealthy Republicans during his foundering reelection campaign. “Here is something that the White House counsel very badly wanted that would have been politically beneficial to the president” says David Rivkin a prominent conservative lawyer who wrote the memo in support of the idea while he was in the White House counsel’s office. “What does it tell you about Bill Barr? It does not seem like the action of a yes man.” Barr during the announcement that he would be the next attorney general under President George H.W. Bush in 1991. (Dirck Halstead/Getty Images) Bush’s defeat by Bill Clinton in the 1992 election shoved the still-youthful attorney general through Washington’s revolving door where he eventually settled in for a long run as general counsel of the telecommunications company now called Verizon. He got rich. He was a foreigner to Washington’s social scene whose aversion to being a joiner meant he didn’t become a member of elite private clubs or even enlist in the Federalist Society the highly influential conservative group so closely aligned with his philosophy. His one big foray into socializing was the annual “ceilidh” parties — named for the traditional Scottish and Irish music-centric get-togethers — that he’d throw at fancy hotels. At other times he’d play bagpipes at gatherings of fellow enthusiasts. (Asked how the first sentences of his obituary should read he says with a loud chuckle there should be only one word: “Piper.”) With copious time on his hands he wrote and sold a screenplay about Capt. Ernest Evans a World War II Naval commander renowned for his heroism fighting a much larger Japanese force. But Barr was out of the action in the halls of Washington power. He knew it. He missed it. His friend Jonathan Turley — a George Washington University law school professor — would sometimes send him draft copies of briefs. Once Turley recalls Barr called him at 2 in the morning from a corporate jet to point out a missing preposition in a footnote on page 20. In 1995 Barr wrote an article for the Catholic Lawyer journal in which he framed a “historic struggle” between “secularism” and “the traditional Judeo-Christian moral system.” They’re themes he has echoed in his current role calling Black Lives Matter activists “Bolsheviks” in a Fox News interview and saying “the left wants power because that is essentially their state of grace in their secular religion.” (On the other hand he says “saving Black lives” through programs such as Operation Legend which dispatches federal law enforcement officers to cities where violence is surging is perhaps his greatest accomplishment.) Barr often argues — citing Catholic thinkers and the Founding Fathers — that the demise of the Judeo-Christian system could imperil the existence of the American government. “For the Republic to work” he wrote in the journal article “people must be guided by ... commonly shared moral values.” It’s a view he still holds telling us that “over the long run the fewer and fewer people who have religion the less stable government becomes.” During the covid-19 pandemic Barr has marshaled his Justice Department to support the right of churches to hold services. In his own words he has “jawboned” governors to treat churches the same as any other public gatherings while imposing restrictions to limit the spread of the killer virus. In his journal article he again took on homosexuality. Barr looked askance at “the effort to apply District of Columbia law to compel Georgetown University to treat homosexual activist groups like any other student group. This kind of law dissolves any form of moral consensus in society” he wrote. Gay and lesbian organizations expressed concern when Barr was nominated to be Trump’s attorney general citing his past comments. Barr’s Justice Department recently filed a Supreme Court brief arguing that Catholic Social Services in Philadelphia which receives taxpayer funding should be allowed to refuse to place adoptive and foster children with same-sex couples. Barr’s longtime friend former Time Warner chief counsel Paul Cappuccio who is in a same-sex marriage and raising three children says: “There is no intolerance in Bill Barr other than perhaps intolerance of stupidity.” Cappuccio had worried about discussing his relationship and marriage with some of his conservative friends and mentors — but not Barr. He recalls Barr coming over to him at a reception not long after he got married in 2013: “I have to meet this guy. I’ve got to make sure he’s the right fit for ‘The Pooch’ “ Barr said using Cappuccio’s childhood nickname. Barr’s preemptive handling of the Mueller report allowed Trump to dominate the initial news cycle and cement a narrative. After stepping down from Verizon in 2008 — the year he turned 58 — he entered a long restless semiretirement in which he did some consulting and was counsel in the Washington office of the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. He also served on the board of the Catholic Information Center a downtown gathering spot and place of worship that has featured priests from the ultraconservative Opus Dei wing of Catholicism. During his first term as attorney general Barr had hired as a speechwriter John Paul Wauck who later became an Opus Dei priest and has kept in periodic touch with him. So many people have assumed that Barr is a member of Opus Dei that the secretive organization issued a statement saying he is not. In those years he would periodically meet Turley for long lunches at a favorite Italian restaurant Assaggi Osteria in McLean Va. where he lives. They’d linger long after the plates were cleared gnawing over large and minuscule points in law. Afterward it wasn’t uncommon for Barr to send Turley lengthy memos — just because. Barr wanted someone to listen to him. In June 2018 Barr sent an unsolicited 19-page memo to the Justice Department the White House counsel and others. In it he argued that even though he was “in the dark about many facts” he wanted to share his conclusion that the investigation by his longtime friend special counsel Robert Mueller seemed to be a “misbegotten effort to ‘disempower’ ” Trump. The president had “illimitable” powers to hire and fire his then FBI director James Comey who’d investigated Russian interference Barr wrote. Once again he’d pushed his objective of building a muscular presidency. But this time there was a president in office who was more than eager to go along. While then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions a Trump loyalist was beginning to have frictions with the president Barr — who is a friend of Sessions — offered private advice on managing the relationship with a difficult Oval Office occupant. Within months of Sessions’ ouster Barr’s name was being floated as attorney general to replace the much-panned interim choice Matthew Whitaker. Unlike some other Trump cabinet choices Barr was not a political supporter of the president’s. He had significant doubts about Trump’s suitability for office a friend says on condition of anonymity. Yet when Trump called Barr accepted the job reasoning that he could reshape the Justice Department to his liking. For the first time in a quarter century Barr was really relevant again. Barr became Trump's attorney general in 2019. In April 2019 emails and text messages flooded into Brian Rabbitt’s phone as Barr’s then-chief of staff sat just behind the attorney general as he testified before a Senate committee. “Twitter is going crazy” one text read. Social media was ablaze because Barr had uttered a single word: “spying.” Rabbitt stiffened when he heard it. He knew trouble was coming. Barr’s unequivocal remark about the intelligence community’s Russian interference investigation gave a lofty imprimatur to the president’s long-standing unsubstantiated claims that the Obama administration had spied on his election effort. It suggested to some that Barr had prejudged the Obama administration’s actions while the attorney general’s investigation into the early stages of the probe was still in its infancy. Before the hearing ended with his staff in a state of high anxiety Barr shifted into damage-control mode telling senators that he’d only meant to say “surveillance.” He was “concerned” and “looking into it.” On the ride back to the Justice Department his senior staff tried to explain the fuss a tempest Barr told them was “ridiculous.” “Barr couldn’t believe it was such a big deal” says a staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate a private conversation. “He really didn’t care what the reaction was.” In the high-wire months to come Barr’s inner circle stood by him and supported his decisions — even as some prosecutors who directly handled investigations and trials resigned in protest over his decisions. They’d bonded over conference tables and cocktails. Barr who isn’t a big drinker keeps bottles of blended and single malt whiskeys in his office for occasional impromptu end-of-the-day decompression get-togethers with his staff. Once during a stopover in Dublin on an overseas trip Barr joined staffers at a divey pub where he knew the musician and was immediately recognized. Barr had memorized the words to the Irish ballads and belted them out. But even some of his closest staff didn’t know about his philanthropic efforts. He now pays tuition for 18 underprivileged kids to attend Catholic schools in New York City from kindergarten through 12th grade as part of a church program he’s participated in for many years. In the weeks after his bombshell appearance at the Senate committee hearing Barr would toss aside his measured tone flatly telling Fox News and the Wall Street Journal that spying had taken place. Barr thought the controversy was so “absurd” that he deliberately chose to use the word “spying” in defiance of media talking heads according to a person familiar with his thinking. Barr poses for photos with guests at the White House Summit on Human Trafficking in January. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The attorney general’s comments — no longer hedging — were only a hint of what many perceived as a Barr-Trump Trump-Barr echo chamber with the two men repeating each other’s themes sometimes months apart sometimes days apart. Trump has frequently said Democrats are trying to stage a “coup.” Barr didn’t dispute that suggestion when asked about it on Fox News but used softer language saying that an “organized effort” may be afoot to remove Trump from office. Critics say their claims about mail-in voting undermine confidence in the upcoming election. The interplay between Trump and Barr on the key election issues has resurrected long-standing allegations that the attorney general is following the president’s lead on prosecutorial decisions. Barr’s choice to intervene and recommend a lower sentence than his courtroom prosecutors in the case of Roger Stone — the political trickster and Trump friend convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice — came shortly after the president tweeted that the prosecutors’ recommendation was unfair. All four Stone prosecutors resigned in protest and more than 1000 former Justice Department officials signed a letter calling on Barr to step down. After the prosecutors learned of Barr’s maneuver — not from the attorney general but from media reports — some of them ended up at the Carving Room a hip restaurant and bar near Washington’s Judiciary Square where the place was filling up with angry DOJ officials. When one of the prosecutors walked in the room erupted in applause. Another prosecutor resigned from a case when Barr sought to throw out the charges against Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The decision which is being held up by a federal judge prompted 2000 former Justice officials to call for Barr’s resignation. Barr also has gone on the offensive against Trump enemies trying to block publication of former national security adviser John Bolton’s unflattering book about the president and taking an unusual step by having the Justice Department replace Trump’s personal attorneys in a defamation suit filed by E. Jean Carroll who says she was raped by the president in the mid-1990s. Those episodes demonstrated a call-and-response pattern: Trump complaining Barr doing. Still Barr is forever protesting that his actions are not dictated by the president. “The president’s constant comments undermined what we were trying to do” says a senior staffer who spoke anonymously to describe closed-door conversations with Barr. “This was a constant frustration.” The same phenomenon appeared in the summer of 2019 when California cut an emissions standards deal tougher than Trump’s plan. The Justice Department made no attempt to block the arrangement until Trump tweeted against it. The next day Justice announced an antitrust investigation of the deal. Career staff questioned the legal and factual basis for the investigation; Barr says he had nothing to do with the decision. And a week after Trump tweeted about alleged bias against conservatives by Google this past summer the Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation of the search giant prompting more internal complaints. “I have no sympathy for that” Barr says about the complaints. “I feel that the antitrust division has been 20 years behind the times and one of the reasons we have these very large companies is because they have essentially fallen asleep at the switch. So it’s time for them to put some elbow grease into this and get things resolved.” Amid the rampant criticisms Barr has said that Stone’s prosecution was “righteous” but the sentencing recommendation was “excessive” a view shared by the sentencing judge. Trump later undercut his attorney general commuting Stone’s sentence and sparing him from serving any time in prison. Barr’s move on Bolton he told us stemmed from his assertion which Bolton disputes that the former national security adviser hadn’t gotten proper pre-publication approvals. Barr says he also disapproved of Bolton writing about officials still in office. And he has framed the decision to get involved in the Carroll case as routine because Trump’s comments disputing her rape claims were made within “the scope” of his work as president. Barr’s actions — whether politically intended or not — have lately aided Trump’s promotion of himself as a law-and-order president with a miles-wide fiat to rule. Barr has marshaled federal law enforcement to tamp down protests in the aftermath of the killing of a Black man George Floyd while in police custody. At times Barr has served as a kind of translator for Trump. When the president without evidence accused Obama of committing treason Barr turned apologist telling CNN in early September that “ ‘treason’ is a legal term. I think he’s using it colloquially. To commit treason you actually have to have a state of war with a foreign enemy but I think he feels that they were involved in an injustice and if he feels that he can say it.” Stuart Gerson a conservative former head of the Justice Department’s civil division under George H.W. Bush sees subtle gamesmanship at play. “Trump is not intelligent or incisive but Bill Barr is both. So in this situation Trump is the tail and Barr is the dog” Gerson says. “Trump is the canvas on which Barr can paint his picture.” He’s always there wherever Barr turns: Trump. Inescapable a figure superimposed in everything Barr sketches. Or is it a trick of the dimming light? During our interview Barr sat back comfortably on the burgundy sofa in his office at home in the realm he has occupied at the beginning of his 40s and 70s. Asked to assess his latest turn as a public servant a sly smile crossed his face. “I’d give myself high grades” he said. “But since we all have foibles I’m not sure it’s an A-plus.” The piper pleased with the sound of it chuckled.

President Trump and Attorney General William Barr are a perfect match. The question is, who’s using whom?,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/09/15/william-barr-president-trump-perfect-match/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
One evening in May 1992 an obscure Catholic lay society in Arlington Va. presented its annual award to a 41-year-old political insider wise to Washington’s sub rosa realms. His name: William Pelham Barr. It was a coup for the Brent Society. Despite its low profile the group had landed a star honoree and featured speaker who had become attorney general of the United States of America just six months earlier after having served a stint as the interim holder of that post. As he was accepting the award the smoke had barely cleared in Los Angeles where violent demonstrations after the acquittal of three police officers in the beating of a Black motorist Rodney King prompted the deployment of thousands of federal troops. The unrest coming just months before a presidential election had thrust America deeper into a painful reckoning with evolving attitudes about race during a tumultuous time. Simultaneously a stubborn public health crisis filled hospital wards with HIV/AIDS the leading cause of death for men between the ages of 22 and 44. The culture wars particularly the fight over abortion were in full flower. Barr now finds himself again presiding as attorney general in an election year this time with the nation convulsed by the coronavirus pandemic and still beset by uncomfortable questions about race. But back then he’d puzzled out why Los Angeles was burning. There had been a “withering” of religious faith since the 1960s Barr said according to the text of his 1992 remarks. “Moral relativism and the pursuit of pleasure” he opined “were the order of the day.” The eruption in Los Angeles he reasoned could in part be attributed to “the general moral decline we see all about us in society.” It was not just the demonstrations that triggered Barr’s notions of an American descent into sinfulness. “Morally bad actions” he said “have bad practical consequences for society: HIV venereal disease is the price we pay among many others for sexual license.” Nearly three decades later the moralizing attorney general is incongruously knit with a profane philandering president who has boasted that his celebrity status gave him license to grab women by the “p---y.” Yet Barr who has railed in recent speeches against sexual “licentiousness” views the president in a more forgiving light. “I don’t consider him amoral” Barr told us matter-of-factly during an early September interview in his snug elegantly appointed Department of Justice office where pulled blinds let in the sparest of light. “I think all human beings have flaws. Everybody. And if we were to insist on perfection in our leaders you wouldn’t really have leaders.” Barr now stands as one of the most consequential figures in the administration of Donald Trump insulating the president from detractors bringing to life Trump’s law-and-order exhortations about public protest joining him in sowing doubt about the integrity of the upcoming election. Trump has turned out to be the ideal vessel for Barr’s decades-long pursuit of a potent “unitary executive” with few checks on his power and broad authority to swat away congressional demands. Theirs is a political marriage of perfect symmetry: a president who wants to do whatever he wants whenever he wants — and believes he can; an attorney general dedicated to endowing Oval Office occupants with expansive power. In Barr’s thinking the president is not the head of the executive branch of government which is a collection of dozens of agencies and sub-departments. Instead as Barr sees it the president and the president alone is the executive branch. Barr once served as attorney general for a president George H.W. Bush with a more modest view of executive power — and of himself. Teaming with Trump a self-centered self-aggrandizing child of privilege offered the opportunity of a lifetime. Few modern American political figures could have been expected to embrace Barr’s vision of a single human being embodying an entire branch of government with such rapaciousness as Trump. “I have the right to do whatever I want” Trump told a group of young conservatives in Washington five months after Barr took office in 2019.

(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) It is hard to know who benefits more from the relationship — who plays the music and who dances to the tune. Both use each other. Barr’s maneuverings have been pilloried as so baldly questionable and advantageous to Trump that his prosecutors have resigned in protest from at least three high-profile cases. Most recently a prosecutor quit the Justice Department entirely amid disagreements over the pace of a Barr-commissioned investigation about the Obama administration’s investigation of Russian connections to Trump’s 2016 campaign. Lumbering and generously jowled with a head of thick salt-and-pepper hair the 70-year-old Barr has become Trump’s legal avatar an explainer and softener of the president’s outrageous remarks (a “deep state” operation is underway to oust him). An enabler of his most audacious plans (sending police in riot gear and military personnel to clear a peaceful protest at the park across from the White House so the president could have a photo op in front of a church). An amplifier of his wild and most fact-challenged claims (mail-in ballots lead to widespread fraud and foreign governments could flood the nation with counterfeit ballots). Little of the sly wit Barr displays in person emerges as he defends the president in television appearances and other interviews that as the election approaches have turned him into the president’s most effective campaign surrogate. Instead he often evinces the mien of the grouchy uncle. “Donald Trump is as much a tool of Bill Barr as Bill Barr is a tool of Donald Trump” says Donald Ayer a former deputy attorney general and Republican stalwart who served with Barr at the Department of Justice in the 1980s and has become one of his most prominent critics. “I think Barr sees Trump as an extraordinary opportunity to advance his agenda which he’s had for many years of making the president an autocrat.” Ayer’s view is shared by many but there are those who want to assure the country that there’s really nothing amiss. Barr’s views about a unitary executive are “not exactly far out” says Michael Mukasey a conservative who served as attorney general under President George W. Bush. “I don’t think that for the Justice Department to take that view and pursue it in particular cases is unreasonable.” Barr says his Catholic faith gives him “a solid grounding and a balance. It’s one of the reasons I really don’t care what people think.” Barr came into office in early 2019 enrobed in the hope even among many Democrats that he would serve as a guardrail for a reckless president. Now Barr’s critics including hundreds of former Justice Department officials want him to resign in shame. “I don’t really care what the public thinks — or especially the media and you know the political class” Barr told us. His Catholic faith he continued gives him “a solid grounding and a balance. It’s one of the reasons I really don’t care what people think.” Before the interview Barr asked whether he should wear a mask when he strolled into the conference room next to his office. Above his head massive murals titled “Justice Triumphant” and “Justice Defeated” loomed at the top of the curved ceiling a tableau that represents the polar opposite views of his rocky tenure as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer. He answered the question about the mask himself cracking that he “thought you’d want to see my lips.” Barr’s shrinking cadre of defenders have found fewer receptive ears for their argument that he is misunderstood and for their laments that history will judge him harshly as a partisan hack. “The attorney general has been politically crucified by his partisan foes and the media” J. Michael Luttig a former federal judge who worked alongside Barr in the George H.W. Bush administration says in a rare interview. The first of Barr’s supposed sins Luttig says is the most elemental and insurmountable: “He is President Trump’s attorney general.” Barr in September. A photograph of George Patton hung in the office of Malcolm Wilkey a respected conservative judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit who served as a World War II intelligence officer in the famed general’s Third Army. The young attorney asking to be Wilkey’s clerk held scant hope of getting the job. But as soon as Bill Barr a military history buff mentioned the Third Army and displayed an encyclopedic knowledge of the war he was in. Wilkey’s periodic lunches with his clerks sometimes devolved into the judge and Barr positioning salt and pepper shakers on the table diagraming battle formations. Barr could charm his colleagues with a ready laugh and a sense of humor that David Hiller a fellow clerk and future publisher of the Los Angeles Times says landed somewhere between “wry and devilish.” Barr was a tangle of improbabilities: a deeply conservative Catholic whose father a Columbia University educator and headmaster of elite private prep schools was born Jewish but enthusiastically embraced Catholicism. In our interview Barr interrupted a question to emphasize that his father’s family members were “secular Jews. They were atheists.” Barr fashions himself an outlier — when he was growing up and now. In elementary school he was the Upper West Side son who studied alongside less fortunate Black Latino and Irish kids whose parents weren’t Columbia educators like his. At Horace Mann the elite New York prep school he attended “everyone” he says “had been to everyone’s bar mitzvah. They all went to temple dances.” He notes “I think there were like three Christians in my class.” The pattern continued while he was attending Columbia amid the counterculture heyday and sexual revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s — a period he views as a demarcation point in America’s moral collapse. In Barr’s freshman year an instructor announced a course would focus on “why organized religion is no longer tenable.” Barr recalls being one of only two students to raise their hands when the instructor asked how many students “believe in organized religion.” Still he got an A-plus when he wrote a counterargument. In Washington the product of highbrow schools became a bit more of a scrapper. In a sea of Harvard- Yale- and Georgetown-pedigreed lawyers he worked on his law degree at George Washington University night school which lacked the same cachet. He’d moved to Washington just two days after marrying the woman who became his wife of more than four decades Christine Moynihan Barr a school librarian who is now retired. The couple have three adult children including a daughter Mary Daly a lawyer who worked at the Justice Department before Barr took office and now is in the Treasury Department. His route to the prestigious Wilkey clerkship wound through a six-year stint at the Central Intelligence Agency where he worked in the Office of Legislative Counsel and the Intelligence Directorate. While there his monitoring of congressional investigations of the intelligence community made him wary of CIA FBI and National Security Agency excesses according to friends and aides speaking anonymously to relate Barr’s private musings. “He believes that the FBI and the national security state is powerful. It can be a force for good — and it can turn into the German Stasi” one aide says referring to the notorious East German security agency. Barr’s cautious view of the intelligence community is more nuanced than that of Trump. But their shared doubts about the FBI’s and CIA’s investigation in 2016 have been the underpinning of Barr’s pre-election Russia probe. He receives frequent updates on the investigation — sometimes daily — which is being conducted by John Durham a U.S. attorney from Connecticut. “I think Barr sees Trump as an extraordinary opportunity to advance his agenda which he’s had for many years of making the president an autocrat” says Donald Ayer a former deputy attorney general who served with Barr at the Department of Justice in the 1980s. Behind the scenes frictions have emerged between Durham and Barr over the attorney general’s pushing his handpicked choice to work faster to publicly issue his findings according to two people familiar with the tensions. Barr made a marked shift in his tone and terminology during our interview veering from his previous statements that Durham and he would likely release a “report” in the summer. Instead Barr used more vague language saying only that there would be a “public accounting” and refusing to discuss the timing. Three days after the interview the Justice Department was rocked by the resignation of a top Durham lieutenant prosecutor Nora Dannehy — a highly public indication of troubled internal discussions about releasing findings so close to the presidential election. Barr’s initial vector to the heights of the American criminal justice system would eventually point through the world of party politics where he became a master speed-climber of interior staircases. He zoomed in just three years from a spot on the team vetting vice-presidential candidates for George H.W. Bush’s 1988 campaign to the post of attorney general — an astonishing rise for a lawyer a decade-and-a-half out of law school. At his first stop in Bush’s administration as director of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel Barr wrote an opinion that cleared the way along with another legal analysis to allow Bush to capture Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and bring him to the United States. Barr resisted congressional requests for the opinion providing a summary that omitted some of his reasoning including the assertion that the president could violate the United Nations charter. “It was like observing an athlete making his signature move” says Harold Hongju Koh a Yale Law School professor who is a former top official in the State Department and Justice Department in Democratic administrations. Koh and others saw echoes of that intransigence and obfuscation in spring of last year during the defining moment of Barr’s tenure as Trump’s attorney general when he released a summary of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign more than three weeks before publicly disclosing the full 448-page report. Barr at the White House on the day Trump signed an executive order on policing reforms in June. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) Barr’s distillation of Mueller’s highly detailed but ultimately wishy-washy report dutifully noted deep in the text of the four-page summary that the investigators had not exonerated the president. But the headline-generating lines of Barr’s summary dealt with the special counsel’s decision not to reach a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice. To Trump’s great benefit Barr left out the damning details of 10 instances of possible obstruction by Trump. In addition Barr left out the key point that Mueller found multiple contacts between Trump campaign officials and people linked to the Russian government and that the campaign looked to benefit from Kremlin interference. Barr’s preemptive handling of the Mueller report allowed Trump to dominate the initial news cycle and cement a narrative even though he was clearly overstating his attorney general’s summary. “No Collusion No Obstruction Complete and Total EXONERATION” Trump tweeted. Ever since Barr and his closest allies have privately puzzled that he hasn’t gotten credit for eventually releasing the report which contains scads of damaging material about Trump. Barr supporter Luttig told us “The fact is that the attorney general could not have more perfectly accurately and faithfully described the special counsel’s conclusions.” Some viewed Barr’s handling of the report as a shocking departure for a respected attorney. But it was more an echo of Barr’s long-held — though selective — disdain for independent counsels. Ken Starr who served as the U.S. solicitor general the first time Barr was attorney general remembers extended chats with Barr decrying a Supreme Court decision that upheld the independent counsel act in a case stemming from a U.S. House of Representatives investigation. “The hellions of an independent counsel demonstrated to us the profound flaws of the [independent counsel] statute” Starr says chuckling a bit at the irony of his distaste for independent counsels given that he was the most prominent independent counsel before Mueller. “That united us in the conclusion that you had to really watch out for Congress and you especially had to watch out for the House of Representatives.” (Barr later looked favorably on Starr’s work as independent counsel saying the law required his appointment.) Barr’s tinkerings at the Office of Legal Counsel have been resurrected in defense of Trump. In May 2019 Trump banked on the current OLC — which relied in part on a 30-year-old opinion Barr had written — to refuse a congressional request to review the president’s tax returns. Still there were moments in his first tenure as attorney general when Barr showed the restraint that so many hoped he’d demonstrate as Trump’s attorney general. In the final stretch of Bush’s term he blocked a plan to have the president unilaterally index capital gains to inflation which would have energized wealthy Republicans during his foundering reelection campaign. “Here is something that the White House counsel very badly wanted that would have been politically beneficial to the president” says David Rivkin a prominent conservative lawyer who wrote the memo in support of the idea while he was in the White House counsel’s office. “What does it tell you about Bill Barr? It does not seem like the action of a yes man.” Barr during the announcement that he would be the next attorney general under President George H.W. Bush in 1991. (Dirck Halstead/Getty Images) Bush’s defeat by Bill Clinton in the 1992 election shoved the still-youthful attorney general through Washington’s revolving door where he eventually settled in for a long run as general counsel of the telecommunications company now called Verizon. He got rich. He was a foreigner to Washington’s social scene whose aversion to being a joiner meant he didn’t become a member of elite private clubs or even enlist in the Federalist Society the highly influential conservative group so closely aligned with his philosophy. His one big foray into socializing was the annual “ceilidh” parties — named for the traditional Scottish and Irish music-centric get-togethers — that he’d throw at fancy hotels. At other times he’d play bagpipes at gatherings of fellow enthusiasts. (Asked how the first sentences of his obituary should read he says with a loud chuckle there should be only one word: “Piper.”) With copious time on his hands he wrote and sold a screenplay about Capt. Ernest Evans a World War II Naval commander renowned for his heroism fighting a much larger Japanese force. But Barr was out of the action in the halls of Washington power. He knew it. He missed it. His friend Jonathan Turley — a George Washington University law school professor — would sometimes send him draft copies of briefs. Once Turley recalls Barr called him at 2 in the morning from a corporate jet to point out a missing preposition in a footnote on page 20. In 1995 Barr wrote an article for the Catholic Lawyer journal in which he framed a “historic struggle” between “secularism” and “the traditional Judeo-Christian moral system.” They’re themes he has echoed in his current role calling Black Lives Matter activists “Bolsheviks” in a Fox News interview and saying “the left wants power because that is essentially their state of grace in their secular religion.” (On the other hand he says “saving Black lives” through programs such as Operation Legend which dispatches federal law enforcement officers to cities where violence is surging is perhaps his greatest accomplishment.) Barr often argues — citing Catholic thinkers and the Founding Fathers — that the demise of the Judeo-Christian system could imperil the existence of the American government. “For the Republic to work” he wrote in the journal article “people must be guided by ... commonly shared moral values.” It’s a view he still holds telling us that “over the long run the fewer and fewer people who have religion the less stable government becomes.” During the covid-19 pandemic Barr has marshaled his Justice Department to support the right of churches to hold services. In his own words he has “jawboned” governors to treat churches the same as any other public gatherings while imposing restrictions to limit the spread of the killer virus. In his journal article he again took on homosexuality. Barr looked askance at “the effort to apply District of Columbia law to compel Georgetown University to treat homosexual activist groups like any other student group. This kind of law dissolves any form of moral consensus in society” he wrote. Gay and lesbian organizations expressed concern when Barr was nominated to be Trump’s attorney general citing his past comments. Barr’s Justice Department recently filed a Supreme Court brief arguing that Catholic Social Services in Philadelphia which receives taxpayer funding should be allowed to refuse to place adoptive and foster children with same-sex couples. Barr’s longtime friend former Time Warner chief counsel Paul Cappuccio who is in a same-sex marriage and raising three children says: “There is no intolerance in Bill Barr other than perhaps intolerance of stupidity.” Cappuccio had worried about discussing his relationship and marriage with some of his conservative friends and mentors — but not Barr. He recalls Barr coming over to him at a reception not long after he got married in 2013: “I have to meet this guy. I’ve got to make sure he’s the right fit for ‘The Pooch’ “ Barr said using Cappuccio’s childhood nickname. Barr’s preemptive handling of the Mueller report allowed Trump to dominate the initial news cycle and cement a narrative. After stepping down from Verizon in 2008 — the year he turned 58 — he entered a long restless semiretirement in which he did some consulting and was counsel in the Washington office of the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. He also served on the board of the Catholic Information Center a downtown gathering spot and place of worship that has featured priests from the ultraconservative Opus Dei wing of Catholicism. During his first term as attorney general Barr had hired as a speechwriter John Paul Wauck who later became an Opus Dei priest and has kept in periodic touch with him. So many people have assumed that Barr is a member of Opus Dei that the secretive organization issued a statement saying he is not. In those years he would periodically meet Turley for long lunches at a favorite Italian restaurant Assaggi Osteria in McLean Va. where he lives. They’d linger long after the plates were cleared gnawing over large and minuscule points in law. Afterward it wasn’t uncommon for Barr to send Turley lengthy memos — just because. Barr wanted someone to listen to him. In June 2018 Barr sent an unsolicited 19-page memo to the Justice Department the White House counsel and others. In it he argued that even though he was “in the dark about many facts” he wanted to share his conclusion that the investigation by his longtime friend special counsel Robert Mueller seemed to be a “misbegotten effort to ‘disempower’ ” Trump. The president had “illimitable” powers to hire and fire his then FBI director James Comey who’d investigated Russian interference Barr wrote. Once again he’d pushed his objective of building a muscular presidency. But this time there was a president in office who was more than eager to go along. While then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions a Trump loyalist was beginning to have frictions with the president Barr — who is a friend of Sessions — offered private advice on managing the relationship with a difficult Oval Office occupant. Within months of Sessions’ ouster Barr’s name was being floated as attorney general to replace the much-panned interim choice Matthew Whitaker. Unlike some other Trump cabinet choices Barr was not a political supporter of the president’s. He had significant doubts about Trump’s suitability for office a friend says on condition of anonymity. Yet when Trump called Barr accepted the job reasoning that he could reshape the Justice Department to his liking. For the first time in a quarter century Barr was really relevant again. Barr became Trump's attorney general in 2019. In April 2019 emails and text messages flooded into Brian Rabbitt’s phone as Barr’s then-chief of staff sat just behind the attorney general as he testified before a Senate committee. “Twitter is going crazy” one text read. Social media was ablaze because Barr had uttered a single word: “spying.” Rabbitt stiffened when he heard it. He knew trouble was coming. Barr’s unequivocal remark about the intelligence community’s Russian interference investigation gave a lofty imprimatur to the president’s long-standing unsubstantiated claims that the Obama administration had spied on his election effort. It suggested to some that Barr had prejudged the Obama administration’s actions while the attorney general’s investigation into the early stages of the probe was still in its infancy. Before the hearing ended with his staff in a state of high anxiety Barr shifted into damage-control mode telling senators that he’d only meant to say “surveillance.” He was “concerned” and “looking into it.” On the ride back to the Justice Department his senior staff tried to explain the fuss a tempest Barr told them was “ridiculous.” “Barr couldn’t believe it was such a big deal” says a staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate a private conversation. “He really didn’t care what the reaction was.” In the high-wire months to come Barr’s inner circle stood by him and supported his decisions — even as some prosecutors who directly handled investigations and trials resigned in protest over his decisions. They’d bonded over conference tables and cocktails. Barr who isn’t a big drinker keeps bottles of blended and single malt whiskeys in his office for occasional impromptu end-of-the-day decompression get-togethers with his staff. Once during a stopover in Dublin on an overseas trip Barr joined staffers at a divey pub where he knew the musician and was immediately recognized. Barr had memorized the words to the Irish ballads and belted them out. But even some of his closest staff didn’t know about his philanthropic efforts. He now pays tuition for 18 underprivileged kids to attend Catholic schools in New York City from kindergarten through 12th grade as part of a church program he’s participated in for many years. In the weeks after his bombshell appearance at the Senate committee hearing Barr would toss aside his measured tone flatly telling Fox News and the Wall Street Journal that spying had taken place. Barr thought the controversy was so “absurd” that he deliberately chose to use the word “spying” in defiance of media talking heads according to a person familiar with his thinking. Barr poses for photos with guests at the White House Summit on Human Trafficking in January. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The attorney general’s comments — no longer hedging — were only a hint of what many perceived as a Barr-Trump Trump-Barr echo chamber with the two men repeating each other’s themes sometimes months apart sometimes days apart. Trump has frequently said Democrats are trying to stage a “coup.” Barr didn’t dispute that suggestion when asked about it on Fox News but used softer language saying that an “organized effort” may be afoot to remove Trump from office. Critics say their claims about mail-in voting undermine confidence in the upcoming election. The interplay between Trump and Barr on the key election issues has resurrected long-standing allegations that the attorney general is following the president’s lead on prosecutorial decisions. Barr’s choice to intervene and recommend a lower sentence than his courtroom prosecutors in the case of Roger Stone — the political trickster and Trump friend convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice — came shortly after the president tweeted that the prosecutors’ recommendation was unfair. All four Stone prosecutors resigned in protest and more than 1000 former Justice Department officials signed a letter calling on Barr to step down. After the prosecutors learned of Barr’s maneuver — not from the attorney general but from media reports — some of them ended up at the Carving Room a hip restaurant and bar near Washington’s Judiciary Square where the place was filling up with angry DOJ officials. When one of the prosecutors walked in the room erupted in applause. Another prosecutor resigned from a case when Barr sought to throw out the charges against Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The decision which is being held up by a federal judge prompted 2000 former Justice officials to call for Barr’s resignation. Barr also has gone on the offensive against Trump enemies trying to block publication of former national security adviser John Bolton’s unflattering book about the president and taking an unusual step by having the Justice Department replace Trump’s personal attorneys in a defamation suit filed by E. Jean Carroll who says she was raped by the president in the mid-1990s. Those episodes demonstrated a call-and-response pattern: Trump complaining Barr doing. Still Barr is forever protesting that his actions are not dictated by the president. “The president’s constant comments undermined what we were trying to do” says a senior staffer who spoke anonymously to describe closed-door conversations with Barr. “This was a constant frustration.” The same phenomenon appeared in the summer of 2019 when California cut an emissions standards deal tougher than Trump’s plan. The Justice Department made no attempt to block the arrangement until Trump tweeted against it. The next day Justice announced an antitrust investigation of the deal. Career staff questioned the legal and factual basis for the investigation; Barr says he had nothing to do with the decision. And a week after Trump tweeted about alleged bias against conservatives by Google this past summer the Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation of the search giant prompting more internal complaints. “I have no sympathy for that” Barr says about the complaints. “I feel that the antitrust division has been 20 years behind the times and one of the reasons we have these very large companies is because they have essentially fallen asleep at the switch. So it’s time for them to put some elbow grease into this and get things resolved.” Amid the rampant criticisms Barr has said that Stone’s prosecution was “righteous” but the sentencing recommendation was “excessive” a view shared by the sentencing judge. Trump later undercut his attorney general commuting Stone’s sentence and sparing him from serving any time in prison. Barr’s move on Bolton he told us stemmed from his assertion which Bolton disputes that the former national security adviser hadn’t gotten proper pre-publication approvals. Barr says he also disapproved of Bolton writing about officials still in office. And he has framed the decision to get involved in the Carroll case as routine because Trump’s comments disputing her rape claims were made within “the scope” of his work as president. Barr’s actions — whether politically intended or not — have lately aided Trump’s promotion of himself as a law-and-order president with a miles-wide fiat to rule. Barr has marshaled federal law enforcement to tamp down protests in the aftermath of the killing of a Black man George Floyd while in police custody. At times Barr has served as a kind of translator for Trump. When the president without evidence accused Obama of committing treason Barr turned apologist telling CNN in early September that “ ‘treason’ is a legal term. I think he’s using it colloquially. To commit treason you actually have to have a state of war with a foreign enemy but I think he feels that they were involved in an injustice and if he feels that he can say it.” Stuart Gerson a conservative former head of the Justice Department’s civil division under George H.W. Bush sees subtle gamesmanship at play. “Trump is not intelligent or incisive but Bill Barr is both. So in this situation Trump is the tail and Barr is the dog” Gerson says. “Trump is the canvas on which Barr can paint his picture.” He’s always there wherever Barr turns: Trump. Inescapable a figure superimposed in everything Barr sketches. Or is it a trick of the dimming light? During our interview Barr sat back comfortably on the burgundy sofa in his office at home in the realm he has occupied at the beginning of his 40s and 70s. Asked to assess his latest turn as a public servant a sly smile crossed his face. “I’d give myself high grades” he said. “But since we all have foibles I’m not sure it’s an A-plus.” The piper pleased with the sound of it chuckled.

‘Mom, help help help help!’,headline,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/05/working-while-parenting-coronavirus-pandemic/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
Everybody’s doing this right? It’s normal. It’s basically what parenting is now. That’s what I keep telling myself whenever I’m hiding in bed for a few extra minutes and trying to get ready to face the day. It helps me to think about all the other families in the same situation. Otherwise it can start to feel impossible like this is all there is and this is the only house left in the world. About this series Voices from the Pandemic is an oral history of covid-19 and those affected. We don’t leave here anymore. We’re on our own island and there’s no way out. Every school lesson for the kids every bit of work I can somehow find time for every meal every chore every activity every thought or conversation — it all happens inside this house. My preschooler has his little desk out in the hallway where he does video lessons and sings his school songs. My fifth-grader third-grader and kindergartner are set up with computers for virtual learning in the living room. The kitchen has been taken over by storage bins for school supplies. The dining area is for virtual P.E. I roam from desk to desk to help with their log-ins and passwords and all the other problems that come up. “Mama I need help. Mom!” I’m trying to do my job so I can pay the bills. I’m trying to take college classes online at night to get myself into nursing school. How? When? Sometimes I go into the bathroom for a few seconds so I can take a breath or send an email and lock the door. This is our fourth week of virtual learning in Arizona. I guess you could say it’s been humbling. My kids are remote learning for at least the first quarter and then the school is going to reevaluate. It’s the right decision. The virus numbers are still bad here. When the school made it official I was like: “Okay. I’m a single mother. I’m used to juggling for my kids. I can handle this.” I manage a doctor’s office and they told me I could work from home. The school emailed advice on how to prepare for distance learning and I took it up to the next level. I printed daily schedules for each of the kids and posted it to their desks. I created a whole system of “Mama Bucks” as a reward to keep them motivated so they could earn fake dollars for movie nights and treats if they had good behavior. I hung a poster on the kitchen wall with our class rules. “Be respectful.” “Raise your hand before talking.” “Do your best.” “Work hard and have fun.” They’re good kids. They tried to follow all the rules but they get sick of staring at a screen and they want to be with their friends. My oldest two boys deal with ADHD and how many 4-year-olds are going to be totally self-sufficient? I was squeezing in five six hours of work each day when I probably should have been sleeping but I guess that was still too much. I started getting emails from their teachers. “Why is this assignment missing?” “Why wasn’t he signed into the video chat for math?” “Is there any way to offer them more support?” I cut back my hours to part-time at the end of the first week and lately they’ve been going down even more. I’ll be lucky if I can find 10 hours to work this week and we could use the money. My boyfriend and I are spending through our savings. I barely make enough to cover my car and my phone but what choice do I have? The kids come first. My boyfriend pitches in with them a lot and my mom helps whenever she can but they need me. They need every piece of me at every minute. The sons of 35-year-old Jessica Santos-Rojo Keanu 10 left Kael 5 middle right and Kailen 8 right are in virtual classrooms at home. Kylian 4 is a preschooler. (Caitlin O’Hara for The Washington Post) Their password isn’t working. Their Chromebook is out of batteries. Their video feed went dead. They need me to give them another writing prompt. They want lunch. They want snacks. They can’t find a pencil. The pencil is broken. The pencil is too sharp. The eraser is the wrong color. They’re bored. They’re tired. They’re hungry. They’re whining. They’re fighting with me and they’re fighting with each other. “Mom why is he looking at me? Mom. MOM! Tell him to stop looking at me!” Sometimes I’ll be talking on the phone to an insurance rep for work but it’s an interruption every few minutes. The preschooler needs to nap but instead he’s throwing a tantrum. He wants to go outside but it’s 110 degrees so it’s Disney Channel on a loop and now I feel bad about that. My kindergartner is learning how to write his numbers and letters so he needs everything. “Mama help. Can you show me?” My fifth-grader is supposed to be writing an essay about negative political propaganda. “Huh? Mom what do they even mean?” My third-grader wants help with his subtraction so I’m trying to show him how to borrow the one but it’s“No. No! My teacher didn’t teach us that way.” So then he’s bouncing off the walls. He’s fast-forwarding through all his videos getting up from his desk and telling me he’s done with all his schoolwork for the day. “What? How? It’s 10 in the morning. How can you possibly be done?” I catch myself snapping and losing my temper sometimes and I hate that. I went through my own issues with being picked apart and bullied at school and I still have the emotional scars. I was the Mexican kid the fat kid four-eyes. It created all kinds of self-worth issues. I want so much better for my kids. I want them to know they’re special and precious. I should be able to do that right? I adore them. None of this is their fault. I can be patient. I can be calm and kind. How hard should that be? I hold up my hand and I tell them I need a minute. I walk away and try to get some air but their voices carry. “Mom now! Mama please! Mom help help help help help help!” I can’t find a safe place to explode. When this is finally over I’m going to drive to one of those places where you can pay money to smash and destroy things because I could have a lot of fun with a sledgehammer right now. But how am I supposed to let it out? There’s never any time. There’s never the right space. I don’t want to snap at my boyfriend because he’s doing everything he can and this whole thing has already taken its toll on our relationship. I tried talking to a few relatives but they don’t have kids so they don’t get it. They were like: “Is it that bad? Maybe you should go back to work.” Like I wouldn’t enjoy getting into my car and driving into the office right now with my nice comfy chair and my personal coffee maker and a door I can close? Thank you. Thank you for that loving advice. The best outlet I have is whenever my boyfriend watches the kids so I can go to the grocery store. He tells me “Why don’t you do a big shop and get it all done at once?” But it’s like: “No. I want to go every day. I want someplace quiet without little hands tugging at me. It’s for my sanity.” I swallow it. I keep it all down. I’ve learned how to hold back my emotions and internalize. My youngest was born at 30 weeks with major heart problems. He was teensy tiny 2 pounds and 11 ounces and he stayed in the NICU for 77 days. I would lose it in the waiting room all the time but I never let him see me cry. I’d go into his room and sing to him smile tell him how proud I was. I showed him love and positivity and believe that it helped. Isn’t that parenting? You take on the hard stuff and you try to give them the good. But lately the exhaustion and depression has started to come out sideways. I’ll catch myself in the shower when I’m finally alone standing and crying under the water. I’ll stay there for a few minutes and let it out. How many more days? How much longer can life continue like this? But then I hear them calling and I put myself together and come back out to help. eli.saslow@washpost.com Read more Voices from the Pandemic More Coronavirus coverage Coronavirus newsletter: Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletter How to help: Your community FAQ: What you need to know about coronavirus,body,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/05/working-while-parenting-coronavirus-pandemic/,www.washingtonpost.com,1600223579509
